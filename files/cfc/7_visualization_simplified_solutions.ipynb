    "### Key Seaborn Principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always specify `data=`, `x=`, and `y=` parameters\n",
    "- Use `hue=` to add grouping by color\n",
    "- Use `palette='Set2'` or `'colorblind'` for nice colors\n",
    "- Use `alpha=0.5` to make overlapping points visible\n",
    "- Use `errorbar=None` to turn off confidence intervals\n",
    "- Filter your data BEFORE plotting to focus on specific subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Seaborn makes visualization simple - you don't need matplotlib for basic plots\n",
    "- Always interpret your visualizations - what story do they tell?\n",
    "- Pandas preparation (filtering, grouping) often comes before visualization\n",
    "- Different plot types answer different questions - choose wisely!"
