    "## Summary: Why Groupby Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you learned to:\n",
    "- Use groupby to calculate statistics for each category separately\n",
    "- Apply the \"split-apply-combine\" mental model\n",
    "- Combine filtering with groupby for complex comparisons\n",
    "- Group by multiple columns to find detailed patterns\n",
    "- Use .agg() to get multiple statistics at once\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills let you answer questions like:\n",
    "- Which states have the highest crime rates?\n",
    "- How has crime changed over time?\n",
    "- Which regions show different patterns?\n",
    "- Are certain crimes increasing while others decrease?\n",

    "### Next Class\n",
    "We'll learn to visualize these patterns, turning our groupby results into compelling charts that tell the story of crime in America.\n",

    "### AI Prompting Tips for Groupby\n",
    "\n",
    "When asking AI for help with groupby:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"I have a DataFrame with columns: state, year, violent_all, totals_violent_all\n",
    "I want to find the average violent crime rate for each state.\n",
    "Should I use groupby with mean() on the rates column or sum() on the totals column?\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Be specific about:\n",
    "- What columns you have\n",
    "- What you're grouping by\n",
    "- Whether you want averages, totals, counts, etc.\n",
    "- Whether you're working with rates or raw counts\n",
