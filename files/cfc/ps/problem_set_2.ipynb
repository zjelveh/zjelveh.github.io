    "\n",
    "On August 7, 2025, the federal government initiated an emergency intervention in DC's public safety system, deploying federal resources to assist the Metropolitan Police Department. Local community organizations want to understand whether this \"Federal Surge\" has had any measurable impact on crime patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've been asked to analyze DC crime data from 2025 to help these organizations understand:\n",
    "- What crime patterns looked like before the federal intervention\n",
    "- Whether there have been changes since August 7\n",
    "- Which wards have been most affected\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis will inform community advocacy and help residents understand the effectiveness of the federal intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use AI tools to help write and debug your code. During the code review, you'll explain your logic and demonstrate you understand how pandas operations work.\n",
