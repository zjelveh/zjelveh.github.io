        "\n",
        "**The Policy Context:** In November 2016, Maryland implemented a major pretrial reform. Before this, judges could set cash bail (hDOB), which meant poor defendants stayed in jail awaiting trial while wealthy defendants could pay their way out. The reform pushed judges toward two clearer options:\n",
        "- either release people on their own recognizance (ROR - they promise to come back to court)\n",
        "- detain them because they're considered dangerous (HWOB - Held Without Bail). Today we'll use visualization to see if this policy actually changed judicial behavior.\n",

        "**1. Practice with Your Own Questions:**\n",
        "   - Think of a question about the pretrial data\n",
        "   - Decide which plot type would answer it\n",
        "   - Create the visualization\n",
        "   - Write what story it tells\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Experiment with Parameters:**\n",
        "   - Try different values for `bins`, `alpha`, `s`\n",
        "   - Try different color palettes: `palette='colorblind'`, `palette='pastel'`\n",
        "   - See what happens when you add or remove `kde=True`\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Use AI for Learning:**\n",
        "   - When you get stuck, copy your code and ask: \"Why isn't this working?\"\n",
        "   - Try: \"How would I modify this plot to show X instead of Y?\"\n",

        "- Describe what each parameter in your code does\n",
        "- Interpret what your visualization reveals\n",
        "- Modify your code when asked (e.g., \"change the hue to period instead of county\")\n",
        "- Explain the difference between line plots, point plots, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots\n",
        "- Use groupby to prepare data for bar charts\n",

        "**Cause:** Forgot to load the data or ran cells out of order\n",
        "**Fix:** Run the cell that loads the data first!\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error 2: \"KeyError: 'column_name'\"\n",
        "**Cause:** Misspelled column name or it doesn't exist\n",
        "**Fix:** Check `df.columns` to see exact column names, copy-paste them\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error 3: Overlapping labels or cut-off text\n",
        "**Cause:** Matplotlib didn't auto-adjust spacing\n",
        "**Fix:** Add `plt.tight_layout()` before `plt.show()`\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error 4: Plot appears but is tiny/huge\n",
        "**Cause:** Didn't set figure size\n",
        "**Fix:** Add `plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))` before the plot command\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error 5: \"ValueError: could not convert string to float\"\n",
        "**Cause:** Trying to plot a text column as numbers\n",
        "**Fix:** Check that your x and y columns actually contain numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "### Error 6: Too many colors in legend\n",
        "**Cause:** Used `hue` with a column that has too many unique values\n",
        "**Fix:** Create a grouping variable with fewer categories first\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "Today you learned:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Visualization reveals patterns** that tables of numbers hide - our brains are wired for visual pattern recognition\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Different plot types answer different questions:**\n",
        "   - Line/point plots → trends over time\n",
        "   - Bar charts → comparing categories and groups\n",
        "   - Histograms → distributions of values\n",
        "   - Scatter plots → relationships between variables\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **The `hue` parameter is magical** - it splits your data into colored groups automatically\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Seaborn has consistent patterns** - data, x, y, hue appear in most functions\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Good visualizations need context** - always add titles, axis labels, legends, and reference lines\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **The bail reform story emerges clearly** from these visualizations - ROR increased, traditional bail decreased, detention stayed stable\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Groupby and visualization work together** - use groupby to prepare aggregated data, then visualize it to reveal patterns\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember: The goal isn't to make pretty pictures. The goal is to **tell a story** that helps people understand patterns in data and make better policy decisions!"
