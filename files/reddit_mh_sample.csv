1.0,21 year old male been dealing with anxiety ever since I can remember. I think I’ve found my happy place and ways of dealing with it. For me to be anxiety free everything has to be almost spot on with my routine. I find that when I’m getting regular exercise with regular meals I’m fine. Every time I drink alcohol not to much whilst but after and the day after I get hit with this anxiety. It’s crippling some days I can’t even leave the house or face anyone. I think it is due to doing stupid shot when I’m drunk so every time I sober up now I’m thinking to myself if I did any stupid shit or said anything dumb whilst drunk. I also over think everything and I think people are always staring at me which sounds so entitled and selfish but it’s the way I feel. Like I said for me to be completely anxiety free is when I’m at home usually out side in the sun chilling with my dogs or when I am at work. I don’t care about anything else. I just want to be happy with my family. I’m sick of having these episodes everytime I drink. Any advice or tips would be much appreciated,Anxiety,Alcohol induced,Drug and Alcohol
1.0,I have had anxiety pretty much my whole life.  It developed very quickly in adolescence around puberty and when it hit just about max level we moved.  New school new city.  From a very small private school to a much larger public school.  I also found out some interesting things about my family.  I had zero trust in the people who were supposed to be closest to me.  Who was I supposed to tell about the why I was feeling upside down. So I developed coping technics that I thought I had perfected.  Avoid anything that makes me uncomfortable as much as I can.  And when forced to do these things puke my guts out in the morning and then don’t eat because i know that will make everything ten times worse.  As I got older I discovered alcohol and that it made me brave and loud and stupid.  That progressed into figuring out how to use it in small doses to control the anxiety in any social environment.  I know how to control my anxiety I know the exact things I need to do what to tell myself when it happens who to call to calm me down.  And the easiest and fastest way.

I’m trying hard to focus on what will actually fix me now and that’s why I don’t appear to be falling apart but I am.  Deeply I want to change and I want to be healthy.

1.0,"Ever since I was a child I’ve had sleep anxiety. I fight off sleeping because I’m so sure that in my sleep I’m going to die. Well, I fear that I’m going to wake up in the process of dying. As a college student I found out I could combat this by drinking large quantities of alcohol. Ill just drink till I’m exhausted, pass out, and usually get an alright night of sleep. Unfortunately, this hasn’t really stopped and now I’m age 30. If I don’t drink, I have extreme difficulty sleeping. But, once I finally get tired, the anxiety kicks in and I start to fight the drowsiness. It’s been a terrible cycle. 

I’ve recently stopped drinking liquor, which has really helped my overall daily anxiety/panic. I do however, still take a low dosage preventative benzo in the morning before work. By the time I get home from work I’ll drink a few beers, and I’ve never had any problems with this combination (don’t try this at home kids). Today though, I took a different med since I ran out of the usual. When I got home, I had one beer (12oz 9.1%) and my world got rocked. I tried my absolute hardest to fight off this combo taking over my brain and I couldn’t win. I got knocked the F out by this combo. I woke up in a panic, and here I am, afraid to fall back asleep.

1.0,"Hi everyone,

A bit of a background. I had two full blown seizures when I was roughly 8 I believe. I went on tegretol but there was only the two seizures. Apparently it was chalked up to an infection/fever, as far as I know these seizures occurred within a week of one another.

Fast forward to last year and I had my first ever panic attack, it was whilst I was driving and it was honestly horrendous. I had recently unexpectedly lost my mother and had been a functioning alcohol for three years, I think this is what caused the panic attacks. For some unknown reason, a thought came into my head that questioned if it was epilepsy. I have no idea where this came from but it was so powerful that the thought stuck. I decided to quit alcohol cold turkey which inevitably caused the anxiety to worsen over time. This resulted in me going to hospital as my vitamin levels had tanked as I was completely exhausted and done.

Now the next part I can't explain. I've always had health anxiety but for some reason I became fixated with epilepsy. I was incredibly anxious about it and it was all I could think about.

Fast forward another month and although I'm still anxious about it, I've somewhat made my peace with it until one day, I was buying something off of Amazon. On their homepage, there was these orange storage lockers and something clicked in my mind that made me aware that I had seen these before but could not place it. I instantly started to have a panic attack, the whole time I was searching my mind to figure out where I had seen these before. It was like a flashback that I couldn't remember. So a few hours later it clicked that I had seen these two days prior when I dropped off a friend to pick up a parcel from one of these lockers.

I try not to think anything of it, but I start to acutely become aware that I am now on high alert for when I start to remember something but it fades, kind of like when you wake up from a dream and the more you think of it, it starts to fade away until its completely gone. At the time the only way I could sum it up was deja vu, it was an eerily fond memory but no recollection of the memory.

During a routine review of my antidepressant, my doctor wanted to know more about my panic attacks. I must of said some keywords because she scheduled me for an appointment with a neurologist the very next day. Apparently this was due to my two seizures as a child.

I explain the panic attacks to the neurologist and the ""déjà vu"". He instantly puts me on elsicarbazepine acetate 400mg then up to 800mg. He is unsure what to diagnose, but on the balance of probability due to childhood seizures, he is 51%/49 in favour of starting the medication until there is an outcome.

During the five months on this medication, these episodes of dream flashbacks continue to occur. The best way I could sum these up is that they are like deja vu, but with a memory I cannot place. Sometimes I can think on the brief image or memory and figure out what it was (like the Amazon lockers). Other times I cannot. I think the weirdest one I had was when I was stood next to a river and I got this sudden onset of anxiety and an image pop up in my mind of a dancing banana... what the hell, right? I continued to think on this for weeks and then one day it clicked. Remember that dancing banana from the Peanut Butter Jelly Time video? It was that...

These continued to happen during my entire time of this medication. As I said, I'm incredibly anxious when it comes to health and my body was hyper sensitive and aware to any physical or psychological changes.

I have asked a lot of people, I have read so many experiences that others have had like mine. They range from people with anxiety, derealisation, depersonalisation, epilepsy, depression.

I've been cleared by medical professionals who have heard me explain this symptom and I am quite frankly embarrassed as I feel like I wasted their time. They have diagnosed me with anxiety but there is this constant what if that bounces around all day and it isn't normal to dedicate this much time and effort to worrying about an all clear.

1.0,"I tried ecstasy for the first time last month, and did it 2 more times after that. That’s a total of 3 times. 

Currently it’s been a month and a couple days and I’ve developed extreme anxiety. Im starting to think the ecstasy might have something to do with it, I’m not 100% sure though. I’ve noticed what triggers my anxiety the MOST is MUSIC and small spaces where I feel claustrophobic.

I’ve never had an issue with anxiety before, until literally last month. 
I’m about to go into details below and explain, Idk if anyone cares that deeply. If you do read it, please let me know if you think it was the ecstasy. 😭

I’ve been smoking for 5 years (an everyday thing, about 5-7 blunts a day) but recently it’s starting to give me panic/anxiety attacks, ESPECIALLY WHEN I LISTEN TO MUSIC. 
I used to smoke and listen to music every morning, as it ironically HELPED with stress and so on... Now when I smoke and listen to music I start to almost become really light headed, and my heartbeat starts racing and I always start to think I’m going faint. 

I thought it was the weed, but I’ve came to the conclusion, the music plays a huge part in it as well. When I turn off the music I can usually calm my self down. 

Also two days ago I was at a party smoking and the music was BLASTING, It made me uncomfortable to the point where I was convinced (lord forbid) that I was going to have a heart attack. I started to feel the left side of my neck hurt and pulse, and I became almost faint. I was so scared.

I don’t think, I need to explain the claustrophobic part, but f*ck it right. I was attempting to ride a greyhound bus, which I’ve done before but I literally can’t. I had to just take a lost on my money, after rescheduling FOUR times. Since greyhound does not do refunds.

(I’ve also had other weird anxiety/panic attacks like when I get left home alone (as I have roommates I used to LOVE having a free house for the weekend) now I always think I might come down with a medical issue, and no one will be there to help or dial 911. It’s horrible I felt like running from the damn house but I have no where to go.

Could this be ecstasy related, it started around the same time I took the last dose of ecstasy. All three times I was high off the EX I was listening to music the whole time. My last ecstasy trip was also kinda weird, I don’t want to say it was “bad” since you can’t have a bad trip off ecstasy. Might have been laced though, I literally felt the comedown (my teeth unclenching almost instantly, I became antisocial right when the comedown started, I was irritated.) 

The day after was when the anxiety started. I kept pacing back and toward, I SOMEHOW had convinced myself the ecstasy had damaged some of my organs. I was cold one min, then the next would get really hot. I was tired but was afraid to sleep and die from hypothermia/overheat, even though I was no long high off the pills. I also started crying and had 911 on “speed dial” and after that day my anxiety has not gotten better..",Anxiety,Can ecstasy cause anxiety/panic attacks?,Drug and Alcohol
1.0,"Hey all.

Yesterday, me and a few friends decided to do shrooms. They are quite experienced, I however, am not. I had never done them before, only smoked a little bit of weed through the years. But due to my anxiety, I laid off weed for a long time.
Long story short, my trip consisted mostly of panic attacks with a few glimpses of things being okay. I had a panic attack an hour or so before I decided to do them (which is probably what contributed to it being such a bad trip.) The panic attack was triggered by multiple things happening yesterday prior to eating the shrooms. Because of my anxiety disorder, as you can imagine, I’m generally an overthinker and nervous a lot.

1.0,"Hello.
This is an annoyance that I really just wanted to get off my chest.

 and was diagnosed with minor anxiety many years ago now (due to a curious existential crises about death I conjured up). Over the course of the year it has just gotten worse, and recently the subject of alcohol has spontaneously included itself in my muddled array of anxiety episodes.

I drink on occasion, mainly the odd alcoholic ginger beer and dry beer, but only have ever gotten ""buzzed"". However, for some reason my anxiety seems to persist with the topic of alcohol and getting drunk. Maybe I'm just scared or over-thinking the experience of getting drunk? I am a light weight: kind of short and skinny, and it doesn't take a lot to get me tipsy, so I'm always wary when I'm drinking, which my anxiety also makes sure of.

How can I alleviate my anxiety over alcohol? How can I feel comfortable with drinking without worrying? Worrying is really irritating me.

1.0,"My main coping mechanisms are food and weed, which I’ve recognized as 2 really shitty coping mechanisms at that. 

I’ve always had an unhealthy relationship with food and emotional eating. Weed just makes stopping eating harder. I could be completely full right before smoking, and 1 hour later I’m looking for something else to eat. When I try to control my calories or eat healthily, it seems like I get a dopamine withdrawal from the shitty foods. Once I go off eating whatever I want, I feel better.

With weed, I only smoke for 10-15 days at a time and try to make myself quit for a couple weeks to a month after that. Recently though, I’ve found it incredibly hard to stop. I stopped for 2 days before today, and those 2 days were hell. I understand craving weed can be a normal thing for a chronic user, but I feel like I’m dependent on it to relieve anxiety. I was already pretty anxious and depressed before, but once I stopped smoking, the depression and anxiety hit me like a brick wall.

Quick backstory: I developed anxiety from smoking weed along with serious religious belief and started having insane panic attacks. Even after the weed I’d still get them sober and they are the worst. 

At first it would always feel like a huge wave of nervousness to my brain to the point where I think I’m gonna pass out or have a seizure. Now it switched over to insane heart racing and shortness of breath, 10 times a day for at least a hour.  I always feel like I’m gonna have a stroke or heart attack and am scared for my life everyday. My single mom works so I’m alone in the house but I never know if I should call 911.

1.0,"My first experience with a panic attack was when I first touched weed.. which was back in Amsterdam I had an edible (yes silly for the first time i know) and I fell asleep and woke up heart racing my brain was telling me I was dying and I had the most traumatic experience screaming shouting convinced I was dying with my ex boyfriend.. this was around 4 years ago and I then had my grandad die which led to more panic attacks and I had to have therapy for it as I didn't know anything about panic attacks back then.

So I very much understand the feeling now and how to handle them but after last night I feel kinda back to square one.. i decided to try smoke weed as I'm stressed out at the minute and just wanted to ease it off and relax and thought I could handle it alot better now I've had therapy for it..  so I smoked some in a field with my sister not even a full spliff and I felt fine, on the walk back I started to feel weird and everything she was saying was slowed down proper bad and longed words out and my heart starting racing to fuck, i could feel the panic coming on as I didn't like how my body was feeling and I could feel my heart way too much it was like an out of body experience and I couldn't cope with it so i even said to her ""I'm about to have a panic attack"" and then I just lost my mind and I guess the adrenaline kicked in and i cant remember much and I had major intrusive thoughts that I couldn't control telling me I need to let everyone know I'm dying to save me from dying otherwise I will die because I'm dying right now and i was paranoid because everything she said i linked it to her saying it because i was dying .. so I was screaming and shouting it was extremely traumatic  I was completely disorientated confused and just felt out of this fucking world..

I have been using alcohol to help with stress/anxiety for a while now, but I would say late 2019 was when it started to get worse. I started off with only drinking a little bit or just enough to get a buzz. I would often do this so I could relax and focus on getting more shit done after being on campus all day. After doing this for a while, I feel like I need to drink until I am very drunk just to get everything off of my mind. I feel like I’ve been relying on alcohol so much. I have completed school projects/essays/etc at home completely drunk. I’ve even felt the need to get a little bit drunk just to talk to people. I did stop drinking for about 2 months and it was hard, but I was doing a little better. I ended up breaking that because I got super stressed about something and now I feel like I’m quickly falling back into my old drinking habits.

I had a panic attack tonight about school/my future and I did not drink enough to block out those feelings and it was scary.

I honestly don’t know where to turn, so here I am. 

2 months ago, I met up with the random girl. 
We did some drugs (coke), and fooled around. 
70% of the encounter was her playing with me. 
When I was taking a turn at her, I rubbed the tip of my dick around her pussy, but did not put it in. Then I fingered her, and we went back to me where I finished up in her mouth. 

Now I am convincing myself she could get pregnant, and she has ghosted me 110%. 

I do believe anxiety plays a big part in this. But I can’t even talk to her to try and calm this. So I can only assume the worst. 

Apparently peeing helps clear sperm. I don’t know when I ejaculated last before this meeting, but I do know I was busy the entire day and not ejaculating; and peeing through out the day. 

To sum it up, my concern is, whatever precum that may have been on my dick, got rubbed around her pussy a bit and then possibly fingered inside her. 

Also, factors on my end that should help me in this case is I’m probably considered over weight. I smoke a pack a day. I drink a 40 of moonshine (or more) a month and do 0.5-2g of cocaine a month and smoke marijuana daily.

Also if pulling out is 95+% effective during penetrative sex, then how could rubbing genitals even prompt any worry at all.

I have social anxiety(i think).

When im supposed to met new people my heart starts pumpin and my hands begin to sweet.

When i wake up and drink coffee or just hang out with my parents i feel constant (altho mild) discomfort

-coffe makes it worse so i try to avoid it-

Sometimes i get self conscious while im talking (as if im listening to myself speaking) so i lose my train of thoughts and just feel mad,sad and annoyed cuz of that.

When i smoke weed i start tripping how all my friends are fucking around with me and its hard for me to relax.

Im not the best at eye contact because i feel like im actually not looking at people but rather i try to see myself through them. Basically I'm trying to monitor my behaviour through their responses and  their perspective of me in that moment,as if their eyes are some kind of mirror. So then i feel that i just can't go back to the unconscious/natural eye contact.

I have worked on all of this problems lately tho.

I realised that my perspective is wrong and that my friends or any people around are NOT judging me and whenever i get that feeling now this kind of logic serves me a shiled and im able to feel okay. It reminds me that im totally fine.

I started working out very strictly which makes me feel good about myself and helps a lot with internal discipline and mindfulness/calmness.

Still it ain't perfect as sometimes it just hits and i cant determine why is it so.

I never had a panic attack, dizziness or anything that severe and for that im really grateful. I see many people here that suffer a lot more then i do and that makes me wanna fight even more.

Advice that i could give right now is...
!!Do not overthink!!- you heard it a million times so i will just explain what that means to me.

You are okay... whatever you will say will be fine!!! Do not try to find the perfect answer, anything you say is good.(Bad advice if you are in quiz or in police station)

I think what fucks us all the most is trying to say to behave and carry our burdens like a god damn superman.

Fear of failure,shame, fear being judged... all those fears come from somekind if LIE/s in us that we carried and breed for so long!! Someting that is not the truth yet something we believe in. It is something irrational and untrue so there no need to bend ourselves to the plain lies. Remember them as lies.
Defend yourself (specially from yourself) like you would defend those you love and care the most. Remember that those people love you maybe even more than you love them and they would support you through anything.. Respect the belief they have in you and love they carry for you and through that you SHALL RESPECT them and you. Let that give you strength whenever new challenging situations arrive. Through that you will be able to have self positive  talk -""i can do this""etc.- Those words won't be  just words anymore because they will have deep meaning and strong foundations that will keep you from your personal ""Grìma Wormtongue"".

Yes I’m aware I am coming here first, but let me explain. I’m getting worried I have lung cancer. 

I have severe anxiety that is relatively uncontrolled, so I have been smoking weed consistently out of a bong for 3 years now, daily. Used to work 5 days a week but since March I’ve smoked almost all day everyday for on average 5 days a week, again out of a bong. 

Recently, my chest has felt more tight when it comes to breathing so getting a deep breathe in means taking a sip of water and clearing my throat or coughing some mucus out, then I can get a full deep breathe in. Sometimes the mucus I cough up is orange/brown. I figure it’s from the dirty bacteria in my bong, so again, worrisome. 

Today my right shoulder is hurting a bit/feeling sore. My neck feels more tignt as well, swallowing I don’t notice much. I have a good cough *when* I am smoking but not much after, it I cough after it’s because I’m anxious and am trying to cough up mucus to feel like I have a clear throat.

I'm worried about going to the doctor's during a pandemic when my area in going into a more restricted stay at home order. I'm worried that most of it is in my head and the doctor is not going to be able to help, or worse be angry with me wasting their time. I'm worried that I have cancer everywhere, and they'll have to start cutting parts out of me immediately.

I hope this is in the right place, but I really need some advice.

I have had moderate to severe anxiety for years now, something I can normally deal with just fine (granted I do smoke weed daily for this, and it helps. Much harder to keep myself together if I haven't smoked in a while)

But increasingly I have HUGE panic attacks when I have to make a decision, especially between two options where I know I should pick the one for whatever reason but personally I would prefer picking the other.
(EG stay at home or go to a family event I'm not super keen on. Many other decisions as well, this is just the one I thought of now) 

Then when I force myself to pick an option, usually the ""responsible"" option, I think I'm fine with it but the anxiety and the NEED to make a choice returns, like I have to justify my choice almost every 10 minutes to myself.

It has gotten to the point where if I have anxiety over a decision I will freak out no matter what I choose in any given situation.

1.0,"Five years ago I began to notice that I was beginning to lose control of my moods. This caused a noticeable rift in my marriage and I was determined to nip it in the bud. A doctor put me on Prozac and Xanax and sent me on my way. The Xanax was slowly increased while my tolerance grew. The doctor didn’t think twice about increasing my dose. 2 years on that regiment disaster struck. We lose a beloved pet and a day later my wife had a still birth. 

This tragedy coincided with a change in workplace. New workplace, new insurance. The new doctors wouldn’t prescribe me Xanax and drastically decreased the amount of Prozac I was on. My mood swings, depression and anxiety were at a lifetime high. I turned to alcohol to bridge the gap a lack of Xanax had made. It only made things worse. I began to steal from work to afford black market prescriptions and alcohol binges. Eventually that caught up with me and I was fired. 

Another new job and a raging addiction. It was a matter of months before I moved to hard drugs. In the time that followed I almost died a dozen times. I was arrested, committed, tried to stop, failed every time, and lost another job. My depression was all consuming. It contaminated every memory, every thought, every action. Panic was my baseline mood. I was at bottom with no light in sight. 

I checked into rehab. Therapy 12 hours a day. Daily visits with the doctor. For the first time someone played with my medication. I failed again and again. Relapsing every time a new antidepressant failed to work. I was on the brink of losing my home, my wife, and my daughter. Four different antidepressants later and I was convinced the only option was for me to succumb to my addiction and to let it kill me. 

That was almost a year ago. My last attempt at finding hope laid with a nurse practitioner. 13 different non narcotic anti anxiety medications. 7 antidepressants later. More relapses than I could count and I began to see it. Hope. Slowly I began to feel a little better. I began waking with less and less weight on my mind. My hands ever so slightly taking hold of the wheel. The nurse continued to push, finding just the right cocktail of Medication, therapy, and behavior I needed to keep chipping away. 

Two weeks ago after a five year journey through the darkest part of my life I began to wake up with positivity, with optimism. It no longer felt like I was in line waiting for my life to begin. And the feeling has begun to increase at a rate I never thought was possible. For what feels like the first time in my life I feel like I have control. 

I am not telling this story to brag. I share this for anyone out there who feels like giving up. Who sees no light at the end of their tunnel and would like nothing more to shrivel up into nothingness. I remember being there. The hopelessness, the darkness, the weight of your mind. I remember being an abused passenger of my own thoughts and fears.  I remember being overwhelmed. I remember hating myself more then my worst enemy. But after all that I am alive. And for the first time I am seeing light. My journey is by no means complete and dark days are waiting for me around every corner. But I feel like I am ready to face them. And I am here to say it is possible.

1.0,"  Hey. I’ve been for the last 6 months struggling but successfully getting tapered off benzodiazepines. I have had a couple relapse but got myself all the way back to where I was before each time and I have never been this low of a dose. I’m almost finished. Another 6 month-year to fully recover.

  I’ve been off and on addicted to different drugs throughout my life since I was 16.  I had a good amount of time when I was sober for several years.  Other drugs I started using again during one of my most recent relapses is heroin which I haven’t been around in over 4 years. Haven’t touched an opiate in 4 years. I don’t know what triggered it. But I was dabbling in other stuff just before like cocaine and ketamine and quit those and had intense cravings.

  Anyways, quitting so many things at once led me to saying fuck it and I did heroin for a month. Long enough to of course have to go through physical withdrawal again.. some days I feel like such a loser. I’ve asked old friends (moved back to my old city temporarily) for stuff and they’ve all talked to me pretty rudely said they were clean and to stay away from them. I thought they all were doing the same stuff.  I guess I was wrong..  I left the area I was living just recently cuz my roommates couldn’t handle my benzo detox anymore. Well one of them couldn’t. I live with my boyfriend and his mom and my boyfriend was really supportive but his mom was treating me really bad. I started staying in my room and not coming out at all for like 10 days until my family came to pick me up.

  I guess what started my relapsing into benzos was they were prescribed by my dentist for my back to back appointments and then I got hooked, I finally felt normal. I felt calm and like I could work with society. They led me to really getting hooked and getting them from friends in the area. And I have now been on them for a year, this coming January. I’ve been tapering the last 4-6 months and I’ve come a long way. But now I’ve got to face opiate withdrawal along with benzo withdrawal and I’m just really saddened that I’m in this kind of position again. It makes me cry writing these couple sentences right now. I can’t believe I’m here again.

  I had an art business I was building. I’m an oil painter and I had commissions to do. I didn’t finish any of them and they paid me. I feel like such shit about it. But I’m took sick everyday to even think of painting. My art business was slowly building after 3 years of hard work every single day I started getting 500$ commissions coming in monthly and my stickers and prints sold pretty quickly. I was going somewhere. 

The trigger was leaving a very abusive relationship with a narcissist. I couldn’t cope with the loss and I started taking more and more Xanax. And I felt normal and I just kept doing that.

  Idk what is in store now. My memory is shot from the pills, I can’t drive myself safely from the medications I’m on, I feel like everyone hates me ( I think it’s mostly in my head although I’ve had people treat me poorly) and I’ve lost my brain and stability temporarily for maybe the next year. I can’t sleep regular. I wake up at 5-8pm and my day starts then so my sleep is backwards. That makes me feel really depressed. 

  Can I turn my life around again? I don’t see many ways except keep going with getting off the meds and face the opiate withdrawal again. I tried once it was awful. Worse than I remember before and last time I was on them over a year daily.  Can I really make it again? I’m 25 and I feel like the clock is ticking and I’m losing so much time I could be building my life. 

  I wanna be successful I wanna build my art business again. Is that even possible again? I feel at a dead end. I don’t know who I am now. Idk what I want. I don’t know what to do. I can’t work I can’t drive. I’m literally forced to do nothing because of benzo withdrawal. I wish I could go back. I wish I could make a change. I feel really helpless at times. I think about ending my life multiple times in a week now for the last year. Can my life return to normal? I don’t know.. I just feel so alone.

Here’s some info if you’re not familiar with benzo detox and withdrawal here’s a very great way to understand it I’ve sent this article to friends and family when they have treated me poorly for my lack of ability to do things day to day: https://w-bad.org/family-and-friends-this-ones-for-you/",depression,Everyday I wake up I see no road ahead of me.,Drug and Alcohol

1.0,"Hello everyone,

I am a 26 year old guy going through a tough time. I have a weak physique and have abused substances for the last 7 years. I smoked a lot, drank a lot and smoked up. . In my head since I had faked it all but hadn't realised. By this I mean that I had just buried many incidents and wasn't aware of it in my waking life. The odd thing is that since we were suffering financially I had to act strong and tough which I did. I acted like an adult but when I did become an adult I acted like a child. This created serious problems in my college life. I noticed at the end of it that I had become hurtful and disrespectful to others since there was deep pain inside which I had never dealt with. 

Now things aren't interesting anymore. Nothing interests me, because of the substance abuse I have hurt my body a lot. I have pain all throughout my body and have also gone through a mild phase of PIED, or something similar. I have crazy image issues because of something that happened multiple times over my school life. This created such issues that even when women wanted to talk I would just run away. Now I feel bad for myself on a daily basis but I am trying. 

I don't have anyone to talk to. And the ones i had i have blocked them all because it has become hard to trust anyone. I once wrote about the abuse in a set of few pages and i left the pages in a person's house and then of course they were leaked. Just before that i was in this metro city where i became quite lonely and used to frequent sex workers, all my vices and ""sins"" were leaked and i was harrassed on an unprecedented level. A college official used to come to my hostel and talk to my hostel mates right below my window. There were noises everywhere, and I somehow managed through it using my anger. Now those nights just haunt me because sometimes I feel till when. I get it I might have messed up my college life, but what about my childhood, i didn't really have control over what was being done. 

And it is my childhood that ruined my college life. I find it all too funny now. Life is just a good joke. Bmi really want to leave my country and go to someplace where no one knows me.",depression,"Depressed and lonely, been like that for 23 years of my life",drug and alcohol

1.0,"I'm a drug addict who suffers with bipolar. I'm a hard-core substance abuser. I clear my drug debts and then I rack them straight back up. I have nothing, but a shitty finance car. I have no job. My mother does drugs with me and she ends up paying all my drug debts. Then her boyfriend comes on the weekend and he pays for all the drugs, the cycle never ends. Then I'm ticking/borrowing drugs and racking up debts. When I'm sober, my bipolar is out of control. The mania is insane. I'm on fluoxetine. I'm not professionally diagnosed, I've waiting for the psychiatric to diagnosis me. Self diagnosing is not good. But the doctor even says I am and has booked the referral. But because of the fluoxetine, I'm getting extremely manic. My eyes get so dilated. Like today, I had to get rid of my cat, because it kept shitting in my room. Which it never use to do. I took it to a rescue place. I was so manic. I was singing to my cat. Driving without a care. Then when I said my goodbyes. I put some music on and start doing manic rapping like a completely unhinged person. Then I got home, listened to podcasts. WAS ABSOLUTELY MISERABLE. The manic was gone. I was lying face down on my bed. Listening to the Magnus Archives. Then I speak to my mom and I get drugs. We do them. I'm in and out driving back and forth to my dealer. Getting drugs, doing them in the kitchen. Driving coked off my head back and forth. Now I'm sitting here typing this. My mom is paying one of my dealers debts off this Friday coming. I feel like such a shit person, I'm wrecking mine and my mothers life. She is a addict and so am I. I take my little brother to school and I'm not the nicest of people. He suffers with autism and adhd and I lose my temper, to the point I have to make him sit in the backseat and I have to wear eardefenders because he touches everything and says all things to make me tick. It's just a endless cycle. It all went down south ever since I met cocaine and lost my job because I got drug tested. Ever since that I'm just a miserable piece of shit. I'm 24 years old, receding hairline i weigh 220 pounds because I constantly binge eat. I'm a shell of a person and if I did have the courage to kill myself. I would of definitely done it by now and you wouldn't be reading this. I've tried walking through parks, abandoned exploration, seeing sights, I recently got a dog. Soon I plan to take her for walks, when she's old enough. (She's a puppy.) All my family know I'm a unhinged bomb which could explode any minute. My mom does everything for me, I could atleast treat her better. But mental health runs through my family. It's like nothing gets through to each and one of us. I have a auntie who is a narc and I use to live with my aunt and grandmother, she forced me to get credit cards and I don't even live with her now. I live with my mom. She uses my credit cards. I've never used the fucking card once. She's brought sofas and fucking god knows what else. But she does pay it off. But that's not the point. I had a argument with her the other day saying I want the cards payed and you to fuck off out my life. My auntie took everything off her mom. Her home. Everything she ever worked for. But that's another story.

I think about just slicing my arm sometimes, deeply just not thinking about it and just thrushing it straight through. I'll probably call the ambulance because then I would realise I don't want to die. But these thoughts come and go. Sometimes I just want to yank my steering wheel into a lamppost. Not another driver that would be selfish. But the lamppost can be fixed surely. Sometimes I just want to go to a store where you buy all materials, doors and kitchen appliances. Just buy a rope and Google how to make a slipknot, buy a bottle of vodka, take all my antidepressants. Obviously before setting up the rope. Once I've taken all them tabs, down that vodka furiously. I know I'm going to die then. So just fucking jump on that rope and end this nightmare. 

That paragraph are my constant thoughts. I've self harmed before. But never majorly. I headbutted a glass panel through before. That was probably the worst thing I done. I drank a whole bottle of bacardi. Boosh! Head through this glass panel. Ear hanging off and head split open. Glass in my head. I even rung a fucking taxi. You should of seen the taxi drivers reaction. Like me casually asking him to take me to the hospital. I pay him the fair. Arrive at the hospital. Blood dripping all down me. I don't even have to book myself in, or sit down and wait. (This was near beginning corona). The nurse took me straight in. I was highly intoxicated and was sarcastically making jokes about what happened. I said someone bottled me because I didn't want to admit I done such a thing. They stitched me up, I have a scar now I'm just forehead and my hair is usually shaved. So it's noticeable. I got sent home. I had no money I paid a random guy to take me home. Got home. Took off my bandage and popped open a beer. 

This is all purely venting, I clearly don't want to die. But I feel like I'm slowly reaching the inevitably of actually doing what my mind is telling me to do.

1.0,"I’ve been seeing one specific psychiatrist for the past 6 months, initially meeting monthly, but just recently once every 2 months. I’m currently prescribed 300mg Buprion XL daily for depression. Originally I was taking Sertraline, but that was changed at my first initial visit.  As expected, he asked about my recreational drug use, I mentioned that I smoke marijuana daily and drink alcohol 2-3 times per week. (Sometimes in excess, sometimes not) He asked me other typical questions, what the substance use does for me, why I use it, why I don’t want to stop using, etc. He was very focused on alcohol use (as I have alcoholism present on both sides of my family) which is 100% understandable.
I see a therapist bi-weekly within the same practice, so over the past few months I’ve been working hard on improving myself, but obviously healing is not linear. Most days I am feeling better, but things are not PERFECT. Just yesterday I had a phone visit with my psych to discuss how I’ve been doing. Told him I’ve been doing well, no issues with medications, and I’m feeling positive. He asked me about my drinking, I let him know I drink 2 days per week maximum, but I have been charting/keeping track of what I drink for my own personal insight (per recommendation of my weekly therapist) and it’s been helping me from excessive consumption. 
His response to me was that it sounds like I am still not taking treatment seriously, and starting next visit I will be required to provide a urine sample for drug testing each time. From what I’ve been reading, it makes sense for a psychiatrist to do initial/random drug testing, but my situation seems out of the ordinary? Does he see something with my progress that I don’t, or does he think I’m lying or I’m not taking my medication? Aren’t urine tests not typically helpful with alcohol use? I was very thrown off by this meeting, and I’m hesitant to schedule the next meeting. I want to clarify that I am NOT afraid of providing a urine test nor would I refuse it when asked of me, but I am asking for an opinion given my situation, as I feel it may not be normal.

I want to take advantage of this feeling tonight, and finally set my foot down to better myself once and for all.

Having generalized anxiety, BPD and depression on top of ADD and an unclear reason as to why I can't seem to commit 100% to things (probably mostly due to my depression and my suppressing habits) makes it bad a combo for when I try to set my mind to any type of goal. Whether it's improving my art, going back to school, dental hygiene, lung care and so on, there's really one thing that I want to tackle right before I get into those cases; alcohol and nicotine. 

I guess my question is what can I do to help me stay positive towards achieving my goals, when often getting discouraged, agitated, hopeless (etc) gets me craving what soothes me so temporarily yet causes a huge list of complications.  It sounds silly, but hearing the simplest answers from someone else might help a bit more than just the thinking I do in my head, at least its what I'm trying to test by posting on here for the first time!

1.0,"I'm a guy in my mid-20's, and I don't think I ever learned how to handle my own emotions internally. There are also very few people that I trust enough to share enough about my life to actually talk about what I'm going through. Because of this, I know that I put way too much weight on the few people that I truly care about, and - without realizing it - rely on them for processing all of my depression and anxiety. I still live with my parents, and - because of reasons - I'm never going to be comfortable talking with them about what's actually going on in my life.

In the past, I've been medicated for anxiety and depression, but one med turned me into a zombie and the other gave me the worst panic attacks / heart arrhythmias of my life. I have a horrible experience with doctors and medications (always feels like they're just trying to give me pills so I can get out), and I can't afford to pay for a professional psychologist right now, as I'm about to be between jobs. I used to self-medicate with alcohol / weed, but I don't / can't use either anymore because of health conditions that emerged after a couple years of drinking way too much.

I really need to learn to handle my own emotions and manage this so that I don't put unreasonable or unfair weight on the people that I care about. Whenever I can't talk to the people that I ""need"" to talk to, my anxiety takes hold and it's hard to not act manipulative. I don't *want* to manipulate anyone. I don't want to hurt anyone. But, it feels like everything I think of doing to process these things with others is manipulative and toxic without me realizing it at first.

Then I get into this loop where I realize that everything that I *want* to do is, in reality, selfish and harmful to the people that I care about the most. And that is the *single thing that I absolutely never, ever, want to do*. It's like I've become the one thing that I swore to never be.

1.0,"To not throw away what I've gained in the last two years I am writing this. Other reasons are to share this with other people who can give me other perspectives other then the people who helped me thus far and are already concerned with me.

It took me two years with my last psychotic episode last summer to feel finally somewhat recovered. Treatment was hard on me and my loved ones. But mostly on me, because I feel I had permanent changes in the way I experienced life itself.

What isn't unimportant to know is the main cause of my psychotic episodes were drug use. In my teens I started drinking, smoking cigarettes and marijuana. After turning 18 until the age of 25 I increasingly abused different types of stimulants, cathinones, amphetamines, but not cocaine. Also MDMA and other research chemicals. Several types of dissociatives, benzodiazepines and a few psychedelics.

It caused me several experiences which were traumatic, but I brushed them off and kept using. Several times I came close to death or so it felt because of tachycardia and overheating.

I smoked marijuana almost every day, but I kept drinking at a minimum since I thought of it as an inferior drug.

At 26 I went psychotic and got committed to a psych ward for several weeks. I never felt so frightened in my life. Not even close to the times I went overboard, although it was comparable to the times I got bad trips from psilocybin mushrooms.

They forced me to take haloperidol and I recovered, not that it healed me, it just got me out of my psychosis. The next day, I went back to smoking marijuana and it caused something I never felt before as in my senses were completely overwhelmed and it felt wrong.
I kept taking the medication for a week and wanted to get off later. After talking to a family member about it, I stayed on.

The haloperidol made me so miserable, I had no emotions on it and felt like a faded image of my old self. I do not even want to remember it felt, it caused me extreme aversion with everything that has to do with psychiatry.
It was just horrible.

To mitigate the depressive feelings I started smoking marijuana again. Until... I became psychotic again, got committed again and put on haloperidol again. This time as a long lasting injection. Again, I couldn't function as a human being. I felt mentally handicapped.

My parent who emigrated told me to go to their country a year and try to recover there, to be away from marijuana.
My loved one with who I am with since a few years also lives there. I went to live with her and her parents.

It was a great decision, but after two months being there I went into psychosis again. This time without consuming anything. The psychiatrist, who had other views as the ones that helped me in my country, told me it was of abstinence. Or withdrawal.

I got committed to a hospital, which was better for me. I absolutely hate psych wards and can't stand the people there as I have my own problems to deal with. They put my on Clorpromazine and antihistamines, which dulled my psychosis and made me able to go home.

Later they added alprazolam to manage my anxiety. I later suspended with guidance of the psychiatrist the antipsychotics but kept taking alprazolam. I found the alprazolam also enjoyable. I knew it was extremely addictive, but since it was part of the treatment I kept taking it. I vaped enormous amounts of nicotine during treatment to not be drowsy all day.

When I found it was time to quit the alprazolam it took me a few months to quit, by decreasing the dose each time. I went from 2mg by decreasing 0.25 each week. It was torture, because loud sounds made me completely stressed out. I couldn't handle hearing any music. My sleeping pattern was very regular.

After quitting, I improved but something was still off. For months I didn't have any issues until may where I became psychotic again and got committed to the same hospital. Same treatment, but without alprazolam, instead they gave me carbamazepine. An antiepileptic drug which acts as a moodstabilizer. The argument was it would control the erratic activity in my brain they saw in the EEG scan the first time (third psychosis).

After finishing that treatment, I had to keep taking carbamazepine, but I didn't like how it made me feel. My greatest wish since day 1 which was four years ago is to feel normal and carefree.

Things are going great now, I am recovering at a very fast pace, noticing changes in my way of thinking. No longer feeling like a debilitated victim of my own mind. The traumas are slowly disappearing and I am accepting my past as it was. Trying to not blame myself.

This I am grateful for, but it was not thanks to a psychologist since I never got one. The strange thing is, since I am trying to become normal again and undertake activities that benefit me I have started to drink alcohol.

This is what bothers me and is a dilemma. I am trying to get myself back on my feet economically and also trying to feel like I can be outgoing again and enjoy things I felt deprived of for the last few years.

I do not want to live trying to be too strict which I know which will cause me to feel guilty when I do slip up.
Or when I do try to go out and have a drink get myself in situations which are dangerous.

However, there have already occured several things which are bothersome, which confirm my thoughts written above. 

The lack of experience drinking all those years while thinking I can handle the same amount of alcohol as I could before has caused me the following;

I took several alprazolam over the course of a day. Lost control of myself and I went out to get a beer, the first drink in years. After that one beer my memory was gone, I got home, went in coma for two days and severely scared my loved ones. I also insulted them verbally while under the influence. Something that is not natural to me.

After talking with them they told me it was better to just have a drink in moderation, instead of doing it like this.
I felt ashamed for several days and thought about what they said.

I drank a few times after that. One time it was raining and asked my loved one to help me get my moped to a dry spot, which triggered the alarm and got me yelling. My loved one thought I was yelling at her. I apologised, told her it was not directed at her and understood it made her look and feel bad.

The third time it went wrong I went to a party, after that went drunkenly on my moped with a friend to a bar to keep drinking beer. Even though it was in the countryside with no cars it was extremely irresponsible. My loved one kept calling me, but I didn't pick up. She went there at 5 am and I got angry at her, yelled at her and we went home.

The next day I apologised to her and after to her parents, which they accepted. I've lived with hem the last two years and they know how I normally am. I told my loved one the amount of trauma and anger I was carrying, because of what happened to me the last few years.

At Christmas Eve, I got drunk again. This time nothing happened, I had fun, I danced with my loved one, we laughed. She wanted to go to bed early, but I wanted to stay up some more. Eventually we went to bed at 11pm.

The next day we barely celebrated Christmas, because that isn't such a tradition here. In the evening I drank something with her father, got inebriated but not drunk. She asked me not to keep drinking, but I did.

At night, she did not like that I did not listen to her and I promised to stop whenever she says she thinks I had enough.

Typing this out, it sounds like I am either a horrible abusive person, somebody staving off to be an alcoholic, or any other negative thing you can imagine especially since my history with drug abuse.

I am very aware of that, I am also aware of the sensitive state I am in. I have found out I have anger issues which I do not express when sober, but I do feel.

However, I feel like I am finding a balance in trying to not deprive myself and not overdoing it. And I keep messing up. Now I am in a somewhat protected environment with people caring about me, but what if it goes wrong when I am by myself?

Or what if I am too harsh on myself and have to accept that I can make mistakes and people can forgive me, as long as I don't keep breaking their trust. Just like I had broken the trust of so many people by being always drugged-out.

This not meaning I take advantage of the trust my loved ones have in me. Since they were by my side the last two years. They are not telling me to not drink at all, but do it in moderation. I need advice on this, but I don't want to be asking them this either.

Honestly, I want to keep drinking but not at the expense of others. I want to be able to trust myself with a few drinks.",mentalhealth,"Recovering from psychosis, but afraid of messing up.",Drug and Alcohol

It felt so freeing. I finally felt what it was like to not be under alcohol’s control. This amazing feeling lasted about 5 days and then I slowly went back to normal.

Lately I've been feeling very confused with my place in this world, what I want to do in the future and who I really am. I've been in my head a lot and have had so many ups and downs in the last year and a half. Its just crazy how so much has changed recently in my life and I'm kinda freestyling life now.

 Prior to this, at 14-15, I started dabbling with alcohol, weed, other stuff (anything I could get my hands on). Graduated to trying other drugs and did a bit too much LSD for a short period of time (like a month). Kinda hate it now lol. And now I haven't done much drugs and I feel so empty. It might sound a bit stupid (considering I never did so much drugs that I was addicted or nothing) but I always feel the urge to do some type of drug just to feel different and I feel like the potential for a drug problem is developing (if that makes sense).

On the day to day I get on pretty fine, minor anxiety here and there, but other than that I manage to maintain a few friendships and kinda keep my family together at home.

Another thing I want to mention is that my circle has grown much smaller (not really a bad thing to be honest) but as a result, I have more time alone and I just think a lot.

I had an easy but high paying job with coworkers I loved.
I was basically okay, but I struggled a bit in school with long term planning and organization. I couldn't finish the final project, so I decided to call a psychiatrist.

I began drinking blissfully for 10-20 years until a wake-up call this year, and now have been sober for 6 months. I've made huge strides in self esteem, my anxiety, so many areas since cutting alcohol. But the pink mist has faded and I'm finding it harder and harder to stave off depression.

Its just not his time to realize he has a problem. It's beginning to feel like that time will never come.

Then I'm ticking/borrowing drugs and racking up debts. When I'm sober, my bipolar is out of control. The mania is insane. I'm on fluoxetine. I'm not professionally diagnosed, I've waiting for the psychiatric to diagnosis me. Self diagnosing is not good. But the doctor even says I am and has booked the referral. But because of the fluoxetine, I'm getting extremely manic.

I think about just slicing my arm sometimes, deeply just not thinking about it and just thrushing it straight through. I'll probably call the ambulance because then I would realise I don't want to die. But these thoughts come and go. Sometimes I just want to yank my steering wheel into a lamppost. Not another driver that would be selfish. But the lamppost can be fixed surely. Sometimes I just want to go to a store where you buy all materials, doors and kitchen appliances. Just buy a rope and Google how to make a slipknot, buy a bottle of vodka, take all my antidepressants. Obviously before setting up the rope. Once I've taken all them tabs, down that vodka furiously. I know I'm going to die then. So just fucking jump on that rope and end this nightmare. 

 I had no money I paid a random guy to take me home. Got home. Took off my bandage and popped open a beer.

1.0,"Just some background, I've been dealing with a horrible depression since high-school (24 now) and I've tried everything to get rid of it. I've been in good shape, I've improved my diet, I've improved my sleep schedule and while these things did definitely help, nothing got me quite over the Hump. I still felt depressed, moody, unmotivated in social life and in school. For the past year I started taking antidepressants, and eventually I got all the way up to the highest dosage (200mg), and while this made more functional and generally more apathetic to the bad feelings (and rhe good ones too), I still wasn't content. All it did was reduce my capacity to feel anything and I dont want that kind of life tho it was an improvement over my life previously where my mind constantly tortured itself. So anyways somebody gave me shrooms and when I did that, i noticed a weird shift in my mood. I did low doses for awhile but I felt a lot more ""in the moment"" i didn't feel like a zombie dragging his feet barely receptive to the stimulus around me, I felt way more engaged for once. Anyways I took low doses for awhile, and the I decided to take a much bigger one and that has made things even better. I feel so much more resilient, Its been so much easier to lose weight which I had gained so much from being on antidepressants and I just feel more in the moment and content.

Now I won't say that its fixed everything, I still have stuff to work on but to those of you who are struggling with depressions, I would definitely recommend if you can.

If this option isn't available to you, I've found a few things that markedly improved my functionality in dealing with my pretty severe depression. 

1. Spinach. Just wilt it in a pan, even a little would do, and eat it with meat or whatever to get it down. Its practically medicine, I definitely a bigger pep in my step when I have ate some spinach. Add other vegetables to for even better effects here.

2. Antidepressants. If you were like me and can barely get out of bed, I recommend getting antidepressants (i took 200mg of sertraline). While it does just make you apathetic, I felt so much more able to accomplish what I needed and made sleeping a lot more easier to do when anxiety isn't so present. 

1+2 together can make a very significant change in life. 

3. Stand with your back straight, neck more aligned and not haunched over. This does a bit to help you think I've found. There have been studies on it and id recommend looking into this particularly if you need help socializing. 

So yea, I just wanted to share my journey with depression, hopefully this can be useful to those of you who have been stuck in similar positions",depression,Shrooms has fixed my depression and obesity problems,Drug and Alcohol

I’ve lost all my friends at home because they all stayed around home for school and I went off to a different country and I’m only home about 3 months out of the year. They all got super close over the last 3 years or so while I’ve been away and they’ve all moved on without me. 

I don’t want to go back to school because all my friends there refuse to see me because my roommate pulled some stupid shit and weirded out a lot of the girls in our group and I can’t distance myself from him and now they won’t see me because I can’t and won’t leave him. I cannot make any new friends because the country I go to school in is on almost complete lockdown and has been since the summer. 

I’ve become an alcoholic and drink everyday just to push out the thought of suicide. I don’t even know if I want to die, I just don’t deserve to live anymore. 

The part of this that has broken me is my girlfriend was supposed to come visit me for New Years, I can almost never see her because we go to different schools and live in different states. She’s the only girl I’ve ever felt any real emotion towards and all I was looking forward to was just being able to see her and hold her in my arms. Out of nowhere, on Christmas and 3 days before she was supposed to come she cancelled on me and is now pissed at me and I don’t even know why. I was so understanding about the situation and I didn’t want to make her upset. 

Now I’m in my room, by myself and I was just diagnosed with the corona virus and she won’t even call to check on me, even though I stayed on the phone with her day after day, night after night when she had the virus for 2 weeks in September. I have a fair amount underlying medical issues, most notably kidney disease. I haven’t been able to get out of bed the last few days because they hurt so much. I can’t even get up to piss and I don’t even want to because pissing hurts so much. 

I think this may be my time to go, I don’t have any friends or future anymore. I’ve always done well in school and all that, but there’s nothing real for me here anymore. I wanted to marry my girlfriend and I promised her a year ago that I would never kill myself and I tried to make things better since then, but they’ve just gotten worse despite my best efforts.
