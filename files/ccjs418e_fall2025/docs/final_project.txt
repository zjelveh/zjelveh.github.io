Final Project Proposal Guide
Due Date: November 2nd, 11:59 PM
Length: 2-3 pages
Weight: 10% of final grade

Purpose of the Proposal
Your proposal is a roadmap for your final project. It ensures you've chosen a feasible topic, found accessible data, and thought through your analytical approach before diving into the coding. Think of it as a contract with yourself about what you'll accomplish by the end of the semester.

What Makes a Good Project?
The best projects have three characteristics:

A clear, focused question - Not "everything about Chicago crime" but "Do domestic violence calls increase during major holidays in Chicago?"
Available, accessible data - Data you can actually download and work with using the skills from class
Appropriate scope - Analysis you can complete with the data operations we'll learn (primarily counting things, calculating averages, and comparing groups)
Required Sections (5 sections total)
1. Research Question (½ page)
Start with your main question, then explain why it matters.

Your main question should be:

Specific enough to answer with data
Broad enough to explore from multiple angles
Interesting to you personally
Example structure:

"My main research question is: [your question here]. This question matters because [real-world relevance]. Understanding this pattern could help [who benefits and how]."

Include 2-3 sub-questions that support your main question:

"What is the overall trend in..."
"How does X vary by Y..."
"Is there a relationship between..."
2. Dataset Description (½ - 1 page)
Describe your data source in detail.

IMPORTANT: You must have already downloaded and opened your dataset before writing this section!

Required information:

Source: Where does the data come from? (police department, FBI, research organization)
Time period (if time based analysis): What years does it cover?
Size: Approximately how many rows? (thousands, millions)
Key variables: List 5-10 important columns you'll use (use the EXACT column names from your dataset)
Access: Include the actual URL where you downloaded the data
3. Analysis Plan (1 page)
This is where you get specific about exactly what you'll do with your data. Be as concrete as possible.

A. Which specific columns will you use? List the exact column names from your dataset and what you'll do with each:

Date or incident_date - to look at trends over time
Crime_Type or offense_description - to compare different crimes
Location or district - to compare different areas
Time or hour - to see when crimes happen
[List your actual column names here]
B. What exactly will you calculate? Be very specific. Not "analyze crime patterns" but exactly what numbers you'll compute:

Counts (How many?):

Total number of [specific crime type] in [specific year]
Number of crimes per [month/week/day]
Number of crimes in each [neighborhood/district]
Averages (What's typical?):

Average number of [specific crime] per day
Average crimes per month in [specific area]
Average [response time/case duration] for [specific crime type]
Percentages (What proportion?):

Percent of all crimes that are [violent/property/drug-related]
Percent of [specific crime] that happen on weekends
Percent of crimes in [downtown vs. residential areas]
C. What groups will you compare? List the specific comparisons you'll make:

Weekday crimes vs. Weekend crimes
Crime in [Neighborhood A] vs. [Neighborhood B]
[Crime Type 1] vs. [Crime Type 2]
[Year 1] vs. [Year 2]
Morning (6am-noon) vs. Evening (6pm-midnight)
D. Step-by-Step Plan Write out exactly what you'll do, using this template:

Step 1: Load my [name of dataset] data
Step 2: Focus on just [specific years/months]
Step 3: Focus on just [specific crime types or areas]
Step 4: Count how many [specific crime] happened each [time period]
Step 5: Calculate the average number of [what] per [time unit]
Step 6: Compare [Group A] to [Group B] by calculating [specific metric]
Step 7: Look for patterns: Is there a difference? How big?
Real Example (Domestic Violence on Holidays):

Step 1: Load Chicago crime data
Step 2: Filter to just 2019-2023
Step 3: Filter to just domestic violence incidents  
Step 4: Count incidents on major holidays (list specific dates)
Step 5: Count incidents on regular days
Step 6: Calculate average DV incidents on holidays vs. non-holidays
Step 7: Calculate percent increase/decrease on holidays
4. Expected Outcomes (½ page)
Describe what you expect to find and how you might show it.

What do you expect to discover?

I expect to find that [specific pattern]
I hypothesize that [Group A] will have more/less [metric] than [Group B]
I think [specific time period] will show [what pattern]
It would surprise me if [unexpected finding]
How might you show your findings? (preliminary ideas - you'll learn visualization later) Think about what types of charts might work (we'll teach you how to make these):

A line graph showing [what] over time
A bar chart comparing [what] across [which groups]
A table showing top 10 [what]
Don't worry about the technical details - just think about the story you want to tell with your data.

5. AI Tool Usage (¼ page)
Describe how you used AI tools (TerpAI, ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) to help develop this proposal and/or how you plan to use it to help you with final project.

Be specific about what you asked AI and how it helped:

Understanding your dataset
Refining your research question
Identifying what analyses are possible
Learning about the topic area
Checking your math/calculations
Improving your writing
Good examples of AI use:

"I asked Claude to help me narrow down my research question from 'crime in Chicago' to something more specific"
"I used ChatGPT to understand what 'clearance rate' means in police data"
"I asked AI to verify my calculation: 'If there are 52 Saturdays and 52 Sundays in a year, and I have 1,248 weekend crimes, is the average 12 crimes per weekend day?'"
"I asked Claude what factors might influence crime patterns on holidays"
Remember: AI is your assistant, not your ghostwriter. Use it to understand and improve, not to replace your thinking.

Proposal Checklist
Before submitting, ensure you have:

✓ A focused research question that can be answered with data
✓ An actual dataset you've located and can access
✓ Specific column names from your dataset listed
✓ Exact calculations you'll perform (counts, averages, percentages)
✓ Specific groups you'll compare
✓ A numbered, step-by-step plan for your analysis
✓ Hypotheses about what you expect to find
✓ Description of how you used AI to develop your proposal
✓ Proper formatting: 2-3 pages, double-spaced, clear sections

Example Analysis Plan (What We're Looking For)
❌ Too Vague:
"I will analyze crime patterns in Chicago and see how they vary across different dimensions."

✅ Good - Specific and Actionable:
"I will compare violent crime rates on weekends vs. weekdays in Chicago's South Side districts."

Here's a complete example of the analysis plan section for the weekend vs. weekday project:

A. Columns I'll Use:

Date - to identify weekends vs. weekdays
Primary Type - to separate violent crimes from property crimes
District - to compare different police districts
Arrest - to see if arrest rates differ
B. What I'll Calculate:

Counts:
Total violent crimes on weekdays (Mon-Fri)
Total violent crimes on weekends (Sat-Sun)
Total crimes in each district
Averages:
Average daily crimes on weekdays (total weekday crimes ÷ number of weekdays)
Average daily crimes on weekends (total weekend crimes ÷ number of weekend days)
Percentages:
Percent of weekend crimes that are violent: (violent weekend crimes ÷ total weekend crimes) × 100
Percent increase on weekends: ((weekend avg - weekday avg) ÷ weekday avg) × 100
C. Groups I'll Compare:

Monday-Friday vs. Saturday-Sunday
Violent crimes (ASSAULT, BATTERY, HOMICIDE) vs. Property crimes (THEFT, BURGLARY, MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT)
District 1 vs. District 2 vs. District 3
D. My Step-by-Step Plan:

Step 1: Load Chicago crime data from 2023
Step 2: Filter to just violent crimes (ASSAULT, BATTERY, HOMICIDE)
Step 3: Create new column marking weekend (Sat/Sun) vs. weekday (Mon-Fri)
Step 4: Count total crimes for weekends vs. weekdays
Step 5: Calculate average crimes per day (weekend total ÷ 104 days, weekday total ÷ 261 days)
Step 6: Calculate percent increase on weekends: (weekend avg - weekday avg) / weekday avg
Step 7: Repeat steps 2-6 for property crimes (THEFT, BURGLARY, MOTOR VEHICLE THEFT)
Step 8: Compare the weekend increase for violent vs. property crimes
What I Expect to Find: I expect violent crimes to increase on weekends compared to weekdays, while property crimes might stay more constant. This would suggest that weekend social activities (bars, gatherings) lead to more interpersonal conflicts.

How I Used AI: I used ChatGPT in three specific ways for this proposal. First, I pasted the column names from my dataset and asked it to explain what "Primary Type" vs "Description" meant in Chicago's crime coding system. Second, I asked it to check my math: "If there are 365 days in 2023, how many weekdays and weekend days are there?" which helped me realize I need to calculate averages, not just totals. Third, I asked what factors might explain weekend crime increases, which helped me think about bar closing times and event schedules as potential explanations.

This level of detail shows you've thought through your analysis!

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
❌ Too ambitious: "I will predict crime using machine learning"
✅ Right-sized: "I will identify patterns in crime across neighborhoods"

❌ Vague question: "I will explore police data"
✅ Specific question: "Do arrest rates for drug crimes vary by neighborhood income level?"

❌ Missing data: "I hope to find data on..."
✅ Data in hand: "I have downloaded Chicago's crime dataset from [URL]"

❌ No clear plan: "I will analyze the data and see what I find"
✅ Structured approach: "First I will filter for violent crimes, then group by..."

❌ Complex statistics: "I will run regression models and predict future crime"
✅ Appropriate methods: "I will count crimes by type and calculate monthly averages"

Final Thoughts
Your proposal doesn't lock you into every detail. As you work with the data, you might discover new questions or need to adjust your approach. That's normal! The proposal ensures you start with a solid foundation.

Final Project: Crime Data Analysis Ideas
Introduction
This page presents a list of common analyses and research questions that data analysts, journalists, and researchers explore using criminal justice data. These represent the kinds of stories that appear in news outlets, academic journals, and policy reports—and by the end of this course, you'll have the skills to tackle most of them yourself.

Note: 

The purpose of this list is to inspire potential topics for your final project. As you read through these ideas, think about what questions interest you most. 

All of these analyses can be completed using the Python skills we're learning in class—primarily pandas operations like filtering, grouping, counting, and calculating statistics. You'll be able to load data, clean it, analyze patterns, and create compelling visualizations to tell your story. The only exception might be geographic "hot spot" analyses that require mapping capabilities, though even these can often be approximated using tables and charts showing crime by neighborhood or zip code.

Remember: good data analysis doesn't require complex statistics or machine learning. Often the most impactful findings come from simple questions answered clearly with basic calculations. The analyses below typically need just one to three data tables, making them perfectly sized for a semester project.

As you explore these topics, consider what data is available (check our resources page), what story hasn't been told yet, and what findings might actually influence policy or public understanding. The best projects combine technical skill with genuine curiosity about the criminal justice system.

At the bottom you will also see a series of suggested analyses. These questions demonstrate that even with basic coding skills, you can uncover important patterns and challenge assumptions about crime and justice. 

Note: You'll notice that many of these analysis topics focus on street crime (violence, property crime, drug offenses) rather than white collar crime (fraud, embezzlement, insider trading, environmental crimes). This isn't because white collar crime is less important or less harmful—in fact, white collar crime causes far greater financial losses than all street crime combined.

The reason for this imbalance is primarily about data availability. Street crime data is systematically collected through standardized reporting systems like NIBRS and local police departments, creating comprehensive datasets with consistent fields across jurisdictions. Every arrest, incident report, and court case generates structured data that's often publicly available.

White collar crime, by contrast, lacks comparable data infrastructure. These crimes are investigated by dozens of different agencies (SEC, FBI, EPA, state attorneys general) with no unified reporting system. Many cases are handled through civil or regulatory proceedings rather than criminal courts, creating scattered records. Corporate crime often goes undetected for years, and when discovered, may be resolved through private settlements with sealed records. The complexity of financial crimes also means that even when data exists, it's often in unstructured formats like court documents and press releases rather than clean CSV files.
