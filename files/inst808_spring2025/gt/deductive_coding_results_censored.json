    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how unconscious human decision-making processes, particularly in the advertising industry, influence ecological outcomes. It uses psychological frameworks to examine how mental shortcuts and heuristics lead to environmentally harmful choices. The methodology includes observational analysis of advertisements, revealing patterns where ads exploit unconscious biases, leading to unsustainable consumption. The findings highlight specific ways advertisements affect consumer behavior, suggesting strategies for more environmentally conscious advertising.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the study uses psychological frameworks, which relates to Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract talks about decision-making processes, heuristics, and biases, which are all subtopics under T8. Specifically, it mentions mental shortcuts and heuristics, which fall under Cognitive Biases (a subtopic of T8). So, T8 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the study's focus is on ecological outcomes and sustainable development. It discusses environmental issues, sustainable consumption, and strategies to mitigate ecological degradation. These elements fall under Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract also mentions resource management and environmental monitoring indirectly through the impact of advertising on consumption patterns. Therefore, T7 is another relevant topic.\n\nLooking at the other topics in the codebook: Machine Learning (T1) isn't mentioned, nor are Digital Security (T9) or Public Health (T10). The study doesn't involve any of their subtopics.\n\nFor subtopics, under T8, Cognitive Biases is clearly present as the study discusses how advertisements exploit unconscious biases. Under T7, the study touches on Resource Management and Environmental Monitoring through the lens of advertising's impact on consumption and environmental awareness.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The abstract spends more time discussing the psychological aspects and how they influence environmental outcomes. So, T8 might take up about 60%, and T7 about 40%.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about T8 and its subtopic Cognitive Biases, so confidence is 5. For T7, while it's present, it's a bit less central, so confidence is 4. The subtopics under T7, Resource Management and Environmental Monitoring, are each rated 4 because they're inferred from the context rather than explicitly stated.\n\nFinally, the disambiguation explanation should clarify that Behavioral Economics is the primary topic due to the focus on decision-making processes, while Sustainable Development is secondary, focusing on the environmental outcomes. The subtopics are identified based on the specific elements discussed within each topic.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The study primarily focuses on Behavioral Economics (T8) as it examines decision-making processes influenced by cognitive biases.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online advertising uses persuasive techniques, but these are affected by cognitive heuristics. It mentions an observational study with 1,000 participants, looking at how heuristics like availability and representativeness influence impulsive decisions. Environmental factors, such as a distracting vs. quiet environment, also play a role. The implications are for marketers, policymakers, and researchers.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nThe abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, so T1 isn't applicable. Sustainable Development (T7) is about environmental and resource management, which isn't discussed here. Digital Security (T9) deals with cybersecurity and privacy, which isn't the focus. Public Health (T10) is about health systems and epidemiology, which also doesn't fit.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) seems relevant because the study looks at how cognitive heuristics (a subtopic of T8) affect consumer decisions. The abstract discusses decision-making influenced by heuristics, which directly ties into Behavioral Economics. \n\nNow, for subtopics under T8, the abstract specifically mentions \"Cognitive Biases\" as a subtopic. The study examines how heuristics like availability and representativeness (types of cognitive biases) influence consumer behavior. There's no mention of other subtopics like Decision Making, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, or Intertemporal Choice beyond the general context.\n\nSo, the main topic is Behavioral Economics (T8), and the subtopic is Cognitive Biases. The abstract doesn't cover other subtopics or topics from the codebook. \n\nI'm confident that T8 is the correct topic because the study focuses on how cognitive heuristics affect consumer decisions, which is a core aspect of Behavioral Economics. The subtopic Cognitive Biases is clearly addressed, so my confidence is high there as well.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on cognitive heuristics and their impact on consumer decision-making, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses challenges related to environmental degradation and cyber-attacks. It proposes a framework that integrates eco-friendly online platforms, cyber-resilience, and intelligent systems. The study uses qualitative research methods and involves interviews with experts in environmental science, computer science, and social sciences. The findings highlight reductions in carbon footprint and improvements in threat detection, suggesting a multi-disciplinary approach.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for topics:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract talks about eco-friendly platforms, reducing carbon footprints, and sustainable online ecosystems. These are directly related to environmental sustainability and resource management, which fall under T7. The proportion here is significant, maybe around 40%.\n\n2. **Digital Security (T9)**: The study mentions cyber-resilience, threat detection, and cybersecurity aspects. These are core elements of digital security. This could take up about 30% of the abstract.\n\n3. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The framework uses intelligent systems, including adaptive algorithms, which are a part of machine learning. This might account for 20% of the content.\n\n4. **Public Health (T10)**: While not the main focus, the abstract touches on policy implications and health equity, which are related to public health. This is a minor part, maybe 10%.\n\nNow, for subtopics:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring (T7's subtopic)**: The study discusses reducing carbon footprints and monitoring online activities, which fits here.\n\n- **Cybersecurity (T9's subtopic)**: Advanced threat detection and resilience against cyber-attacks are mentioned, aligning with cybersecurity.\n\n- **Supervised Learning (T1's subtopic)**: The use of adaptive algorithms suggests the application of supervised learning techniques.\n\nI need to ensure that each topic and subtopic is clearly distinguished. The abstract's focus on integrating sustainability and security with intelligent systems helps in pinpointing the main topics and their subtopics accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses sustainable development through eco-friendly platforms and resource management, aligning with T7.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about the integration of renewable energy sources and threat detection mechanisms in social media platforms. It mentions using reinforcement learning algorithms for threat detection and discusses energy consumption patterns. There's also a focus on creating eco-friendly and secure systems, which ties into sustainable development and digital security.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the main topics. The abstract clearly discusses renewable energy, which falls under Sustainable Development (T7). It also talks about threat detection, which is part of Digital Security (T9). I don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1) as a primary focus, even though reinforcement learning is a subtopic under T1. Similarly, there's no direct link to Behavioral Economics (T8) or Public Health (T10). So, the main topics are T7 and T9.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion each topic takes. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing renewable energy and its impact, which I'd say is about 60%. The threat detection part, under Digital Security, takes up the remaining 40%.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions reinforcement learning, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning (T1). However, since the main focus isn't on the learning algorithm itself but on its application in threat detection, I'm a bit uncertain about assigning a high confidence here. But since it's explicitly mentioned, I'll include it with a confidence of 4.\n\nI also considered whether there are other subtopics, like Renewable Energy under T7, but the abstract doesn't delve into specific subtopics beyond reinforcement learning. So, I'll stick with that.\n\nIn terms of disambiguation, the key was recognizing that while reinforcement learning is a subtopic, the broader context of threat detection and renewable energy points to the main topics of Digital Security and Sustainable Development. This helps in accurately assigning the topics and subtopics without confusion.\n\nOverall, I'm confident in identifying T7 and T9 as the main topics, with reinforcement learning as the subtopic. The proportions and confidence levels reflect the emphasis and clarity in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of renewable energy sources (aligned with Sustainable Development, T7) and threat detection mechanisms (aligned with Digital Security, T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the intersection of eco-friendly practices and data privacy in physical activity monitoring systems. It mentions incorporating environmentally conscious design and data protection mechanisms. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, evaluating the effectiveness of eco-friendly materials, energy-harvesting technologies, data anonymization, and encryption. The findings suggest users are willing to compromise functionality for sustainability and data protection, contributing to a framework for integrating environmental stewardship and data protection.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract talks about sustainable development, specifically in the context of eco-friendly design, renewable energy (like energy-harvesting technologies), and resource management (use of eco-friendly materials). This clearly falls under T7: Sustainable Development. The discussion of environmental practices and resource management is a significant part of the abstract, so I estimate about 60% of the content relates to this topic. My confidence is high, so I'll rate it a 5.\n\nNext, the abstract addresses data privacy and protection, mentioning data anonymization and encryption. These are aspects of Digital Security, specifically under T9: Digital Security. The focus on safeguarding personal data is a key part of the study, so I'll allocate 40% of the abstract to this topic, with a confidence rating of 4.\n\nFor subtopics, under Sustainable Development (T7), the abstract discusses Renewable Energy (energy-harvesting technologies) and Resource Management (eco-friendly materials). Both are explicitly mentioned, so I'll include these with a confidence of 4 each. Under Digital Security (T9), the subtopics are Data Protection Mechanisms (anonymization and encryption), which are directly addressed in the study. I'll rate this with a confidence of 4.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention cybersecurity threats or authentication methods, so those aren't applicable here. Similarly, there's no discussion of behavioral economics or public health, so those topics aren't relevant.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily covers Sustainable Development and Digital Security, with specific subtopics in each. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure the proportions add up to 100% and the subtopics are correctly identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Data Protection Mechanisms\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of eco-friendly practices and data privacy in physical activity monitoring systems.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let's start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about wearable devices in the fitness industry. It mentions issues with energy consumption and user anonymity. The study designed a new device that's eco-friendly, uses less energy, and anonymizes user data. They used a mixed-methods approach with 200 participants. The results showed energy savings and improved anonymity. The implications discuss sustainability and technology intersection.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present.\n\nFirst, the main topics. The study is about wearable devices, which are a technology. It discusses energy efficiency and environmental impact, which relates to sustainability. So, I think Sustainable Development (T7) is a key topic because it's about reducing carbon footprint and resource management. Also, the device uses advanced algorithms, which is a Machine Learning (T1) aspect. The study's implications mention the intersection of technology and sustainability, which ties into Sustainable Development.\n\nNext, the subtopics. Under Sustainable Development, the abstract mentions energy consumption reduction and resource management, so \"Resource Management\" is a subtopic. It also talks about environmental monitoring through the device's impact, so that's another subtopic. For Machine Learning, the device uses algorithms for data anonymization, which is a form of data processing, but the codebook doesn't list a specific subtopic for that. However, the study's approach is methodological, which could relate to \"Reinforcement Learning\" as a subtopic under Machine Learning, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nI don't see any mention of Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract, so those topics aren't relevant here.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a good portion discussing the environmental impact and energy efficiency, so Sustainable Development (T7) might take up about 60%. Machine Learning (T1) is discussed in terms of algorithms, but it's a bit less emphasized, so maybe 40%. They sum up to 100%.\n\nFor confidence, I'm pretty sure about Sustainable Development (confidence 5) and Machine Learning (confidence 4) because the abstract clearly mentions energy and algorithms. The subtopics are a bit trickier, so I'll rate them 4 each.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other topics. The study's mixed-methods approach doesn't fall under any other codebook topics. The focus is on the device's efficiency and data handling, which ties back to the two main topics.\n\nSo, in summary, the topics are T7 and T1, with subtopics under each. I think that's all.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the development of an eco-friendly wearable device, focusing on energy efficiency and user anonymity.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about a qualitative study that looks at the intersection of cyberinfrastructure governance, artificial intelligence, and eco-friendly power systems within educational institutions. It mentions the governance of cyberinfrastructure, the application of AI in optimizing power systems, and eco-friendly power systems for reducing environmental impact.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The codebook has topics like Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nCyberinfrastructure governance and AI seem related to Digital Security (T9) because they involve governance and security aspects. The part about eco-friendly power systems and reducing environmental impact points towards Sustainable Development (T7). I don't see any mention of health or epidemiology, so Public Health (T10) isn't relevant here. Machine Learning (T1) is mentioned through AI, but the focus is more on the application in power systems rather than the ML techniques themselves, so it's a minor part.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: Cyberinfrastructure and AI take up about 40%, Sustainable Development about 35%, and the minor part on AI as ML is 25%. \n\nFor subtopics, under Digital Security (T9), the relevant subtopic is Cybersecurity. The abstract discusses the governance of cyberinfrastructure to prevent threats, which fits under Cybersecurity. Under Sustainable Development (T7), the subtopic Renewable Energy is mentioned because the study talks about eco-friendly power systems like solar and wind.\n\nI'm pretty confident about Digital Security and Cybersecurity because the abstract clearly discusses governance and security aspects. For Sustainable Development and Renewable Energy, it's also clear since the focus is on eco-friendly systems and reducing environmental impact.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the main topics are Digital Security and Sustainable Development, each with their respective subtopics. The confidence levels are high for both topics and their subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cyberinfrastructure governance and artificial intelligence, which fall under Digital Security (T9) and Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a qualitative study on integrating cyber-resilience measures into educational institutions. It mentions the use of AI and deep learning techniques to enhance data security and reduce energy consumption. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, including interviews and literature reviews. The findings highlight the effectiveness of AI-driven data protection and its impact on energy efficiency and sustainability.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content of the abstract to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the main topics. The abstract talks about AI and data protection, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). It also discusses sustainability aspects like energy efficiency and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). There's no mention of Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10), so those can be ruled out.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract extensively discusses AI and its applications in data protection and energy efficiency. It also touches on sustainability outcomes. I'd say about 60% of the content is about Machine Learning (T1) and 40% about Sustainable Development (T7).\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract specifically mentions AI and deep learning, which are part of Neural Networks. Under Sustainable Development (T7), the focus is on energy efficiency and reducing emissions, which falls under Resource Management and Environmental Monitoring. However, since the abstract doesn't explicitly mention all subtopics, I'll only include the ones clearly present.\n\nI'm confident about identifying T1 and T7 as the main topics. The subtopics are a bit more specific, but they align well with the content discussed.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n- Topics: T1 (60%) and T7 (40%)\n- Subtopics: Neural Networks and Environmental Monitoring\n\nI'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring the proportions sum to 100% and confidence ratings reflect my certainty.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of AI and deep learning (subtopics under Machine Learning) and the impact on energy efficiency and sustainability (subtopics under Sustainable Development).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that integrates computational methods with insights into human decision-making and environmental stewardship to enhance marital relationships. It mentions using algorithms, preference elicitation mechanisms, and adaptive algorithms. It also talks about environmental sustainability and its impact on relationships.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions \"sophisticated algorithms,\" \"adaptive algorithms,\" and \"computational models.\" These terms are directly related to Machine Learning, specifically the subtopics like \"Neural Networks\" or \"Supervised Learning.\" So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) is evident because the study incorporates environmental sustainability into decision-making. The abstract talks about \"environmental stewardship,\" \"environmental sustainability considerations,\" and \"environmentally conscious behaviors.\" These align with T7's subtopics like \"Renewable Energy\" and \"Environmental Monitoring.\" So, T7 is present as well.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is another topic. The abstract discusses human decision-making processes, preference elicitation, and how these affect relationship dynamics. Terms like \"decision-making processes\" and \"preference elicitation mechanisms\" fall under Behavioral Economics, specifically the subtopics \"Decision Making\" and \"Cognitive Biases.\" Therefore, T8 is also present.\n\nDigital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) don't seem to be mentioned. There's no discussion of cybersecurity, privacy, or health-related topics. So, these topics aren't relevant here.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing computational methods and algorithms, which are core to Machine Learning. I'd say about 40% of the abstract is dedicated to T1. Sustainable Development is a major focus, especially with the emphasis on environmental sustainability and its impact on relationships. That's about 35%. Behavioral Economics, while important, is discussed in the context of decision-making and preferences, which is around 25%.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning, \"Neural Networks\" or \"Supervised Learning\" could be relevant, but the abstract doesn't specify. However, the use of algorithms suggests a broader application, so maybe \"Transfer Learning\" isn't directly applicable. Alternatively, since the abstract doesn't specify, perhaps no subtopic is explicitly mentioned. Similarly, for Sustainable Development, the focus is on environmental sustainability, which aligns with \"Environmental Monitoring\" or \"Resource Management,\" but again, the abstract doesn't specify a particular subtopic. In Behavioral Economics, \"Decision Making\" is clearly discussed, so that's a subtopic.\n\nWait, but the user's example didn't include subtopics, so maybe the subtopics aren't explicitly mentioned. Alternatively, perhaps \"Decision Making\" is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm only identifying topics and subtopics that are explicitly mentioned or strongly implied. Since the abstract doesn't specify particular subtopics beyond the broader topics, I might not have enough evidence to confidently assign subtopics. However, \"Decision Making\" is a clear subtopic under Behavioral Economics, so I can include that with high confidence.\n\nIn summary, the topics present are T1 (Machine Learning), T7 (Sustainable Development), and T8 (Behavioral Economics). The subtopic identified is \"Decision Making\" under T8.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses computational methods (Machine Learning), environmental sustainability (Sustainable Development), and decision-making processes (Behavioral Economics).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about a multi-disciplinary study that integrates artificial general intelligence, cognitive psychology, and ecological stewardship to optimize matrimony. They use AI-driven decision support systems, specifically mentioning reinforcement learning. The study's findings show improvements in relationship satisfaction and reductions in conflict, as well as positive environmental impacts.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions AI, decision support systems, and specifically reinforcement learning, which is a subtopic under T1. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The study discusses ecological stewardship and pro-environmental behaviors, which relate to environmental aspects. However, the focus seems more on the application in relationships rather than broader sustainable development. So, T7 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) deals with decision-making influenced by psychological factors. The study looks at how AI helps in decision-making for relationships, which touches on individual and collective well-being. This seems relevant, but the abstract doesn't delve deeply into behavioral economics theories or frameworks, so it's a minor presence.\n\nDigital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) don't seem to be addressed in the abstract. There's no mention of cybersecurity, privacy, health systems, or epidemiology.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The majority of the abstract is about AI and reinforcement learning, so T1 takes up about 60%. Sustainable Development is mentioned in the context of ecological stewardship and environmental behaviors, which is about 25%. Behavioral Economics, while present, is more tangential, so around 15%.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract explicitly mentions reinforcement learning, which is a subtopic under T1. There's no mention of other subtopics like neural networks or supervised learning. So, the subtopic is reinforcement learning with high confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't discuss cognitive biases or decision-making frameworks beyond the AI's application, so reinforcement learning is the only subtopic identified.\n\nIn summary, the main topic is Machine Learning with a significant portion, followed by Sustainable Development and Behavioral Economics to a lesser extent. The subtopic is clearly reinforcement learning.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of Machine Learning (T1) through reinforcement learning in optimizing relationships.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about creating smarter cities and secure, efficient stadia. The user wants me to identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the abstract to understand the main points. It talks about safeguarding information, user experiences, and integrating technologies with urban planning. They mention a survey of stadium administrators, architects, and security experts. The key challenges and opportunities are in implementing integrated systems that prioritize fan safety and convenience. They found that multi-factor verification, biometric authentication, and real-time data analytics are important. There's a mention of supervised pattern recognition algorithms for predicting security threats.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these points to the topics and subtopics. The main areas discussed are security technologies and machine learning. \n\nStarting with Digital Security (T9), the abstract talks about safeguarding information, multi-factor verification, biometric authentication, and real-time data analytics. These are all under the umbrella of digital security. The proportion here is about 60% because a significant part of the abstract deals with these security measures.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions supervised pattern recognition algorithms, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). Specifically, supervised learning is a subtopic here. The proportion for this is around 40% since it's a key part but not the entire focus.\n\nI don't see any mentions of Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10). The focus is clearly on security and machine learning.\n\nFor subtopics, the key ones are Authentication Methods (from T9) and Supervised Learning (from T1). These are explicitly mentioned in the abstract, so the confidence is high for both.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention neural networks, reinforcement learning, or other subtopics from T1. It's specifically about supervised learning. Similarly, for T9, it's about authentication methods and data analytics, which are part of digital security.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the topics are T9 (60%) and T1 (40%). The subtopics are Authentication Methods and Supervised Learning, each with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of advanced technologies with urban planning to create secure and efficient stadia.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the given codebook. Let's start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about integrating advanced authentication protocols, data-driven urban planning, and predictive modeling techniques for high-stakes events like international competitions. They mention using a mixed-methods survey with stakeholders, and the results show that authentication methods like biometrics and AI verification enhance security. They also discuss data-driven urban planning with smart infrastructure and real-time monitoring, and predictive modeling using supervised learning.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present.\n\nFirst, for TOPICS:\n\n1. **Digital Security (T9)**: The abstract mentions authentication methods like biometric identification and AI-powered verification. These are part of Digital Security, specifically under subtopics like Authentication Methods and Cybersecurity. The discussion on enhancing event security also ties into Digital Security.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The part about data-driven urban planning strategies, smart infrastructure, and real-time monitoring systems relates to Sustainable Development, particularly the subtopic of Resource Management and Environmental Monitoring.\n\n3. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The use of predictive modeling techniques, specifically supervised learning algorithms, falls under Machine Learning. Supervised Learning is a subtopic here.\n\nI don't see any mention of Behavioral Economics (T8) or Public Health (T10), so those can be excluded.\n\nNext, estimating the proportion each topic takes in the abstract:\n\n- **Digital Security (T9)**: The abstract discusses authentication methods in detail, which is a significant portion. Maybe around 40%.\n- **Sustainable Development (T7)**: Urban planning and infrastructure are discussed, taking about 30%.\n- **Machine Learning (T1)**: Predictive modeling with supervised learning is a key part, around 30%.\n\nNow, for SUBTOPICS:\n\n- **Authentication Methods (T9)**: Directly mentioned with biometric and AI verification.\n- **Resource Management (T7)**: Discussed through data-driven urban planning and smart infrastructure.\n- **Supervised Learning (T1)**: Explicitly mentioned as part of predictive modeling.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from the codebook mentioned in the abstract.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should reflect these findings with the appropriate topic IDs, proportions, confidence levels, and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses authentication methods (Digital Security), urban planning (Sustainable Development), and predictive modeling (Machine Learning).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study examining how educational administrators allocate resources, considering factors like institutional priorities, resource scarcity, and personal values. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining surveys and case studies. The findings highlight correlations between environmental conservation and sustainability initiatives, community involvement and social equity, and academic achievement with academic programs. The study emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach to resource management and provides insights for policymakers and educators.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics fit this abstract.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8). The study focuses on decision-making processes, which is a core aspect of Behavioral Economics. The abstract mentions factors influencing decisions, such as personal values and institutional priorities, which align with the subtopics of Decision Making and Cognitive Biases. The discussion of how different priorities affect resource allocation also touches on Social Preferences.\n\nNext, the study touches on Sustainable Development (T7) through the lens of environmental conservation and sustainability initiatives. However, this is a secondary focus, as the primary emphasis is on the decision-making process rather than the sustainability outcomes themselves.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The methods used are mixed-methods, but they don't relate to any of these topics.\n\nFor subtopics under Behavioral Economics, Decision Making is clearly present as the study is about how administrators make allocation decisions. Cognitive Biases are implied by the influence of personal values and perceived scarcity. Social Preferences are evident in the focus on community involvement and social equity.\n\nIn terms of proportions, Behavioral Economics takes up about 70% of the abstract, while Sustainable Development is about 30%. The confidence for Behavioral Economics is high (4/5), and for Sustainable Development, it's moderate (3/5) since it's a supporting theme.\n\nSo, the identified topics are T8 and T7, with their respective proportions and confidence levels. The subtopics are Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, and Social Preferences, each with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Preferences\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses decision-making processes and factors influencing resource allocation, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study examining how educational resources are allocated and how individuals, specifically students and teachers, make decisions in this context. It uses a survey method to gather data from both students and teachers, looking at their preferences regarding resource allocation. The findings highlight a disparity between students' and teachers' preferences, suggesting a disconnect that affects educational policy and practice. The study also considers institutional factors like school size and socio-economic context, emphasizing the need for a nuanced approach in resource allocation.\n\nNow, I'll go through each topic in the codebook to see which ones apply.\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or related methodologies. It's focused on survey-based research and decision-making processes, not computational models. So, T1 isn't present.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: This topic relates to environmental and resource management in a sustainable context. The abstract deals with educational resource allocation but doesn't discuss sustainability, renewable energy, or environmental impact. Therefore, T7 isn't applicable.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: Behavioral economics looks at how psychological and social factors influence economic decisions. The study examines decision-making processes, specifically how students and teachers allocate resources, which touches on individual preferences and choices. This seems to fit under Behavioral Economics, as it involves understanding the factors influencing these decisions.\n\n4. **Digital Security (T9)**: This topic involves cybersecurity and data protection. The abstract doesn't mention any security concerns or digital threats, so T9 isn't relevant here.\n\n5. **Public Health (T10)**: Public health focuses on population health, disease prevention, and health systems. The study is about educational resource allocation, not health-related issues, so T10 isn't applicable.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only topic present is Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract is entirely focused on decision-making processes within an educational context, which falls under Behavioral Economics. There's no mention of other topics, so the proportion for T8 is 100%.\n\nLooking at subtopics under T8, the abstract discusses decision-making processes (Decision Making) and the influence of perceived needs and expectations, which relates to Cognitive Biases. Therefore, both \"Decision Making\" and \"Cognitive Biases\" are relevant subtopics.\n\nI'm confident about identifying T8 as the main topic since the study revolves around decision-making influenced by individual and institutional factors. The subtopics are directly supported by the discussion of preferences and the disparity between students and teachers, indicating cognitive biases and decision-making dynamics.\n\nI don't see any overlap with other topics, so the disambiguation is clear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on decision-making processes and preferences, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses two main issues: identity theft/fraud and the spread of infectious diseases. It talks about using biometric authentication methods, such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning, to mitigate these problems. The study uses a survey approach with 1,000 participants and finds that biometric authentication reduces identity theft and fraud, as well as the transmission of infectious diseases by up to 35%.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to map these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for the topics:\n\n1. **Digital Security (T9)**: The abstract focuses on biometric authentication methods, which fall under Digital Security. The discussion of identity theft and fraud directly relates to this topic. The proportion of the abstract dealing with this is significant, probably around 60%.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: The study also examines how biometric authentication can reduce the spread of infectious diseases. This aspect ties into Public Health, particularly in the context of disease prevention and health systems. This might take up about 40% of the abstract.\n\nNext, for the subtopics:\n\n- **Authentication Methods (T9's subtopic)**: The abstract specifically mentions biometric authentication methods, which is a subtopic under Digital Security. This is clearly addressed, so confidence is high.\n\nI don't see any mention of other subtopics from other topics. For example, there's no discussion of neural networks or epidemiology, so those aren't applicable here.\n\nIn terms of disambiguation, the abstract clearly distinguishes between the technical methods (Digital Security) and the health outcomes (Public Health). The focus on authentication methods solidifies the subtopic under Digital Security.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses biometric authentication methods (Digital Security) and their impact on identity theft and fraud, with a secondary focus on reducing infectious disease transmission (Public Health).

It mentions techniques like multi-factor authentication (MFA), behavioral analysis, encryption protocols (TLS), and risk-based authentication (RBA). It also touches on user education in online security.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, the abstract talks about verification methods, encryption, and authentication, which clearly fall under Digital Security (T9). The discussion of MFA, RBA, and encryption protocols directly relates to Digital Security. The proportion of the abstract dealing with these technical aspects is significant, probably around 60%.\n\nNext, the study mentions user education and participants' ability to recognize phishing attempts. This part deals with human behavior and education, which aligns with Public Health (T10), specifically in the context of health promotion and education. This section is about 20% of the abstract.\n\nThere's a mention of machine learning-based behavioral analysis, which ties into Machine Learning (T1). However, this is a specific application within the broader context of Digital Security, so it's a subtopic under T1. The proportion here is smaller, around 15%.\n\nSustainable Development (T7) and Behavioral Economics (T8) don't seem to be present. The abstract doesn't discuss environmental issues, resource management, or economic decision-making beyond the technical security aspects.\n\nFor subtopics, under Digital Security (T9), the relevant subtopics are Cybersecurity and Threat Detection. The abstract discusses methods to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches, which are aspects of Cybersecurity and Threat Detection. The confidence here is high.\n\nUnder Machine Learning (T1), the subtopic is Supervised Learning, as the study uses machine learning for behavioral analysis. The confidence is moderate because it's a specific application within a broader context.\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Digital Security (60%), Public Health (20%), and Machine Learning (15%).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study examining the relationship between marital relationships and ecological sustainability. It uses a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. The study looks into consumption patterns, waste management, environmental awareness, and the role of communication in shaping ecological decision-making. The implications suggest leveraging marriage for promoting sustainability and the need for gender-sensitive approaches.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7) because the study is about ecological sustainability, which falls under this category. The abstract discusses environmental concerns, consumption patterns, waste management, and the role of marital relationships in ecological consciousness. These are all aspects of sustainable development, particularly in the context of environmental monitoring and sustainable cities.\n\nNext, the study uses a mixed-methods approach, which isn't directly a topic in the codebook but relates to research methodology. However, the codebook doesn't have a topic for research methods, so I might not include it unless it's a subtopic elsewhere.\n\nLooking at subtopics under Sustainable Development (T7), the abstract touches on environmental monitoring (through data collection on consumption and waste) and sustainable cities (by examining how marital relationships can influence sustainable practices). These are subtopics under T7.\n\nI don't see any direct mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). The focus is on the relationship between marriage and sustainability, not on methodologies like machine learning or behavioral economic theories.\n\nTherefore, the primary topic is Sustainable Development (T7), and the subtopics are Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities. The proportion of the abstract dedicated to T7 is significant, covering the entire study's context and findings, so I estimate around 80%. The confidence is high since the focus is clear.\n\nI should also note that while the study uses mixed methods, it doesn't fall under any other topic in the codebook, so it's solely under T7.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the relationship between marital relationships and ecological sustainability, which falls under the topic of Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on long-term relationships, focusing on the dynamics between partners and their well-being. It mentions using a mixed-methods approach, including in-depth interviews and surveys. The study highlights emotional support, conflict resolution, and relationship satisfaction as key factors. It also notes the interdisciplinary approach, drawing from psychology, sociology, and anthropology.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics align with the abstract's content.\n\nFirst, I consider each topic:\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or related methodologies. It's focused on social sciences, not computational methods. So, T1 is not present.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: This topic involves environmental, economic, and social sustainability. The abstract doesn't discuss any aspects related to sustainability, renewable energy, or resource management. Therefore, T7 isn't relevant here.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: This topic deals with how psychological and social factors influence economic decisions. While the study looks at human behavior in relationships, it doesn't focus on economic decisions or use behavioral economics frameworks. So, T8 isn't applicable.\n\n4. **Digital Security (T9)**: This topic is about protecting digital information and systems. The abstract doesn't mention anything related to cybersecurity or privacy technologies. Thus, T9 isn't present.\n\n5. **Public Health (T10)**: This topic involves protecting and improving population health. The study focuses on relationship dynamics rather than public health issues, disease prevention, or health systems. Therefore, T10 isn't relevant.\n\nSince none of the topics from the codebook are explicitly mentioned or implied in the abstract, I conclude that there are no topics present. Consequently, there are no subtopics to identify either.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not overlooking any indirect references. The abstract uses methodologies like mixed-methods, interviews, and surveys, which are common in social sciences but not tied to the provided codebook topics. The interdisciplinary approach mentioned includes psychology, sociology, and anthropology, none of which correspond to the codebook's topics.\n\nTherefore, my final assessment is that the abstract doesn't align with any of the predefined topics or subtopics in the codebook.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on relationship dynamics and well-being, employing mixed-methods and interdisciplinary approaches.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online platforms use algorithms to curate information, but human cognitive biases affect the effectiveness of these systems. It mentions a mixed-methods approach, integrating cognitive psychology and computer science. The study looks at how users interact with algorithmically curated content, finding that users overestimate the relevance of recommendations, leading to 'algorithmic reliance.' It also talks about the correlation between cognitive styles and susceptibility to biases, with specific mention of need for cognition and cognitive flexibility. The study suggests incorporating debiasing strategies and transparency mechanisms. The contributions include a framework for analyzing biases, a method for mitigating them, and the need for interdisciplinary approaches.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are cognitive biases and their impact on algorithmic systems. The codebook has topics like Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nThe abstract heavily discusses cognitive biases, which fall under Behavioral Economics (T8). It also touches on algorithms, which are part of Machine Learning (T1). However, the primary focus is on how cognitive biases affect algorithmic systems, so Behavioral Economics is the main topic. Machine Learning is mentioned but in a supporting role.\n\nFor subtopics, under Behavioral Economics, the abstract specifically mentions cognitive biases, decision-making, and risk assessment. The study examines how biases influence decision-making in the context of algorithmic recommendations and assesses the risk of over-reliance on these systems.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract, so those topics aren't relevant here.\n\nSo, the topics identified are T8 (Behavioral Economics) and T1 (Machine Learning). The proportion for T8 is higher since the study is centered around cognitive biases and their impact, while T1 is less emphasized but still present. The subtopics are Cognitive Biases, Decision Making, and Risk Assessment, all under T8.\n\nI'm confident about T8 being the primary topic and the subtopics mentioned. T1 is present but to a lesser extent, so my confidence is slightly lower there.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses cognitive biases and their impact on algorithmic systems, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of computational models with human decision-making in social media contexts. It mentions adaptive frameworks, transferable knowledge, and mixed-methods approaches. The findings highlight improvements in identifying high-quality information and reducing misinformation, emphasizing context-aware adaptation mechanisms. The implications are for social media governance, policymakers, and platform designers.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Machine Learning (T1) because the abstract talks about computational models, adaptive frameworks, and transferable knowledge, which are all related to machine learning techniques. The subtopics under T1 include Transfer Learning, which is explicitly mentioned as transferable knowledge. So, T1 is definitely a topic, and Transfer Learning is a subtopic.\n\nNext, the abstract discusses human decision-making, biases, and the interplay between computational models and human judgment. This relates to Behavioral Economics (T8), as it deals with how psychological and cognitive factors influence decisions. The subtopics under T8 include Decision Making and Cognitive Biases, both of which are discussed in the abstract. Therefore, T8 is another topic, with Decision Making and Cognitive Biases as subtopics.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on the interaction between computational models and human behavior, not on sustainability, security, or public health issues.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing computational models and their integration with human decision-making, which falls under Machine Learning. However, a large part also deals with the human aspects, which is Behavioral Economics. I'd estimate about 60% on Machine Learning and 40% on Behavioral Economics.\n\nFor confidence, I'm quite sure about Machine Learning being a topic, so confidence 5. Behavioral Economics is also clearly present, so confidence 4, as it's a bit more context-dependent but still evident.\n\nRegarding subtopics, Transfer Learning is clearly mentioned, so confidence 5. Decision Making and Cognitive Biases are discussed, so confidence 4 each, as they are central but require interpreting the context.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily covers Machine Learning and Behavioral Economics, with specific subtopics under each. There's no overlap with other topics from the codebook.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses computational models and human decision-making, aligning with Machine Learning (T1) and Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of advanced analytics and wearable technologies in professional sports, focusing on athlete performance enhancement. It mentions the need for safeguarding sensitive athlete information and explores anonymization techniques to protect data. The study uses a correlational design, analyzing datasets with biometric, physiological, and performance metrics. They found that a hybrid approach combining k-anonymity and differential privacy reduces re-identification risk and maintains data accuracy. The implications for data privacy in sports are highlighted.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main focus is on data protection and anonymization techniques. This falls under Digital Security (T9), as it deals with protecting data and ensuring privacy. The abstract doesn't mention any other topics like Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10). So, the primary topic is T9.\n\nFor subtopics under T9, the abstract specifically mentions anonymization techniques, which are part of Digital Security. The methods used, like k-anonymity and differential privacy, are techniques within the broader category of Digital Security. Therefore, the subtopic here is \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies.\"\n\nI should estimate the proportion of the abstract related to T9. The entire abstract revolves around data protection and anonymization, so it's about 100% focused on T9. My confidence is high, so I'll rate it 5.\n\nFor subtopics, \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\" is clearly discussed, so I'll rate that confidence as 5 as well.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other topics. The abstract doesn't discuss methodologies from other fields like Machine Learning beyond the context of data protection. It's solely focused on security measures, so no other topics apply.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to T9 as the main topic with a subtopic in Privacy Enhancing Technologies.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses data protection and anonymization techniques within the context of athlete data, which falls under the broader topic of Digital Security (T9).

The abstract doesn't mention anything about machine learning, sustainable development, behavioral economics, or public health, so those topics (T1, T7, T8, T10) aren't present.\n\nFor subtopics under Digital Security (T9), the abstract specifically talks about cryptographic methods like homomorphic encryption and differential privacy. These fall under the subtopic \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies.\" There's no mention of other subtopics like Cybersecurity, Authentication Methods, Threat Detection, or Security Policy.\n\nSo, the analysis should identify T9 as the only topic, with a high proportion of the abstract dedicated to it.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about transitioning to eco-friendly practices in educational institutions. It mentions environmental stewardship, data protection, and artificial intelligence. They're looking at how these elements can create a safer and more sustainable academic environment. \n\nSo, the study examines the relationship between green energy adoption, data protection measures, and intelligent systems for cyber threat prediction. They found that green energy reduces carbon footprint, and intelligent systems help detect cyber threats early. Data protection measures also reduce cyber-attacks.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to map these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract discusses artificial intelligence, specifically intelligent systems for predicting and preventing cyber threats. That falls under Machine Learning (T1). The subtopics under T1 include Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. The use of intelligent systems here seems to relate to Supervised Learning or maybe even Transfer Learning, but the abstract doesn't specify the exact type. So, I'll note Machine Learning as a topic with a decent proportion of the abstract.\n\nNext, the study is about sustainable practices in educational institutions. That points to Sustainable Development (T7). The subtopics here include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, etc. The abstract mentions green energy sources and reducing carbon footprints, which directly relates to Renewable Energy. So, Sustainable Development is another main topic.\n\nThe abstract also touches on data protection and cyber threats, which is part of Digital Security (T9). The subtopics under T9 include Cybersecurity and Threat Detection. The study talks about robust data protection measures and early detection of cyber threats, so Cybersecurity and Threat Detection are relevant subtopics here.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the proportion each topic takes in the abstract. Sustainable Development seems to be a major focus because it's about eco-friendly practices and their impact. So, maybe around 40%. Machine Learning is discussed in the context of intelligent systems, which is significant but perhaps a bit less than Sustainable Development, so 35%. Digital Security is also a key part, especially regarding data protection and cyber threats, so 25%.\n\nFor subtopics, Renewable Energy is clearly mentioned with green energy sources, so that's a strong subtopic. Cybersecurity is discussed in terms of data protection measures, and Threat Detection is about early detection of cyber threats. These are both present but maybe with slightly lower confidence since the abstract doesn't go into deep technical details.\n\nI should also consider if any other topics are present. The abstract doesn't mention anything about Behavioral Economics or Public Health, so those can be ruled out.\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Sustainable Development, Machine Learning, and Digital Security. The subtopics are Renewable Energy, Cybersecurity, and Threat Detection. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure the proportions add up to 100% and confidence ratings reflect how clearly each element is discussed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the convergence of green energy (T7 - Sustainable Development), intelligent systems (T1 - Machine Learning), and data protection (T9 - Digital Security).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses integrating renewable energy sources with advanced data analytics and machine learning to optimize energy production and mitigate cyber threats. It mentions using machine learning algorithms for detecting and mitigating cyber threats, and it talks about renewable energy, which falls under sustainable development. There's also a focus on cybersecurity, which is a subtopic under digital security.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics present are Sustainable Development (T7) and Digital Security (T9). The abstract doesn't mention Machine Learning (T1) as a separate topic because it's used as a tool within the study, not as the primary focus. Similarly, while there's a mention of integrating different areas, it doesn't touch on Behavioral Economics (T8) or Public Health (T10).\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends about 60% on Sustainable Development, discussing renewable energy and its integration. Digital Security takes up about 40%, focusing on cyber threats and detection. \n\nSubtopics include Renewable Energy (from T7) and Cybersecurity (from T9). The abstract doesn't mention other subtopics like Resource Management or Threat Detection explicitly, so those aren't included.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. For example, while machine learning is a subtopic under T1, it's used here as a tool within the broader context of sustainable development and digital security. Therefore, the main topics are T7 and T9.\n\nI should also check if any other subtopics are mentioned. The abstract talks about optimizing energy production and consumption, which relates to Renewable Energy. It also discusses detecting cyber threats, which is Cybersecurity. There's no mention of, say, Health Promotion or Cognitive Biases, so those aren't relevant here.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the subtopics with their confidence. The disambiguation explanation should clarify how topics and subtopics were distinguished, emphasizing that machine learning is a subtopic under a broader topic but isn't the primary focus here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of renewable energy and machine learning for optimizing energy production and mitigating cyber threats.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that integrates social media platforms with laboratory science and ecological monitoring. The main goal is to enhance human well-being and ecological resilience. The methods used include mixed-methods: laboratory experiments, social media analytics, and stakeholder interviews. The findings suggest that social media can play a role in community engagement and environmental sustainability.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The codebook includes Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, neural networks, or related methodologies. So, T1 is not present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The study focuses on environmental issues, ecological resilience, and community engagement towards sustainability. These are key aspects of sustainable development. The abstract also mentions policy implications, which ties into sustainable development's broader goals. So, T7 is definitely present.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) involves decision-making, cognitive biases, etc. The abstract discusses community engagement and perceptions towards environmental issues, which touches on behavioral aspects. However, it doesn't delve into the psychological or cognitive factors in depth. So, T8 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\nDigital Security (T9) deals with cybersecurity and privacy. The abstract doesn't mention any security aspects related to digital platforms, so T9 isn't present.\n\nPublic Health (T10) includes epidemiology, health promotion, etc. The study touches on human health in relation to environmental degradation but doesn't focus on public health methodologies or policies. So, T10 is present but minimally.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The majority of the abstract is about integrating social media with ecological monitoring and community engagement, which falls under Sustainable Development (T7). So, T7 would take about 60%. Behavioral Economics (T8) is about 20% as it relates to community perceptions and engagement. Public Health (T10) is around 20% as it touches on human health impacts.\n\nFor subtopics, under Sustainable Development (T7), the abstract mentions environmental monitoring and sustainable cities. The study uses social media analytics, which relates to environmental monitoring. The goal of enhancing human well-being and ecological resilience ties into sustainable cities. So, both subtopics are present with high confidence.\n\nUnder Behavioral Economics (T8), the study discusses community perceptions and willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviors, which relates to decision-making and social preferences. So, these subtopics are present with moderate confidence.\n\nUnder Public Health (T10), the study touches on the relationship between environmental pollutants and human health, which relates to epidemiology and health promotion. So, these subtopics are present with moderate confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping the evidence. The abstract doesn't explicitly mention all subtopics, but the context allows me to infer their presence.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the subtopics with their confidence. I'll also provide a brief explanation of how topics and subtopics were distinguished.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Preferences\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Epidemiology\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The study primarily focuses on integrating social media with ecological monitoring and community engagement, aligning with Sustainable Development (T7).

It mentions a mixed-methods approach, including laboratory experiments and literature reviews. The study found correlations between social media usage and pollution levels, suggesting social media can be a proxy for environmental health. It also talks about leveraging social media data for better environmental strategies and implications for urban planning, environmental policy, and public health.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for the topics:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract focuses on environmental monitoring and management, which are directly related to sustainable development. The study's implications for environmental sustainability and resource management clearly fall under this topic. The majority of the abstract discusses environmental outcomes and interventions, so this should be the primary topic.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: The abstract mentions public health implications, particularly in urban areas, and discusses the need for environmental education and awareness programs. While this is a significant part, it's secondary to the main focus on environmental monitoring and management.\n\nI'll estimate the proportions as 70% for T7 and 30% for T10, with high confidence in both identifications.\n\nNext, for the subtopics:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring (T7's subtopic)**: The study extensively discusses using social media as a tool for environmental monitoring, analyzing pollution levels, and integrating social media data into monitoring systems. This is a clear match with high confidence.\n\nI don't see evidence of other subtopics from the codebook in the abstract.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe study is about human decision-making in childcare, considering environmental factors and technological innovations. They used a mixed-methods approach, including interviews, surveys, and observations. The findings talk about mental shortcuts and rules of thumb used by childcare providers, which relates to cognitive biases. Parents' perceptions are influenced by cues like cleanliness, which ties into decision-making and cognitive biases as well.\n\nThey propose using technologies like authentication mechanisms (biometric identification, secure logins) and data-driven feedback systems. This part definitely touches on Digital Security, specifically subtopics like Authentication Methods and maybe Threat Detection if we consider the safety aspects.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics I see are Behavioral Economics (T8) because of the focus on decision-making and cognitive biases. There's also a mention of Digital Security (T9) due to the technology solutions proposed. \n\nFor proportions, Behavioral Economics seems to take up about 60% of the abstract since a lot is discussed about decision-making and biases. Digital Security is about 30% because the technology solutions are a significant part but not the majority. The remaining 10% might be other areas not covered in the codebook.\n\nAs for subtopics, Cognitive Biases (T8) is clearly present. Authentication Methods (T9) is also there because of the mention of biometric identification and secure logins. I'm pretty confident about these identifications, so I'll rate them a 4 each.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention anything about cybersecurity beyond authentication, so I think that's the main one. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the topics are Behavioral Economics and Digital Security with their respective proportions and confidences. The subtopics are Cognitive Biases and Authentication Methods, each with a confidence of 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"Other\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses decision-making processes influenced by cognitive biases (T8), which is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study examining the relationships between anxious engagement, parental decision-making, and childcare quality. It uses behavioral theory and public health frameworks. The methods include a mixed-methods approach with surveys and interviews. The results show that parents' anxiety affects their engagement and decision-making, influenced by cognitive biases like the availability heuristic and loss aversion. The study suggests using digital tools and authentication methods to mitigate these biases and enhance engagement. It emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary approaches and better policies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The codebook includes Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nFirst, the abstract mentions behavioral theory, which is part of Behavioral Economics (T8). It also discusses public health frameworks, so that's Public Health (T10). There's no mention of Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, or Digital Security, so those are out.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the proportion of the abstract each topic covers. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing behavioral theory and cognitive biases, which are under Behavioral Economics. Public Health is mentioned in the context of frameworks and policy implications, but it's a supporting element. So, I'll allocate 70% to T8 and 30% to T10.\n\nFor confidence, I'm very sure about Behavioral Economics because of the focus on decision-making and cognitive biases. Public Health is mentioned, but it's more about the application rather than the core focus, so confidence is moderate.\n\nNow, for subtopics. The abstract specifically mentions cognitive biases like the availability heuristic and loss aversion, which are subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8). There's also a mention of digital tools and authentication methods, which fall under Digital Security (T9). However, the abstract doesn't delve deeply into these subtopics, so my confidence is moderate.\n\nPutting it all together, the topics are T8 and T10, with subtopics Cognitive Biases and Authentication Methods. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring the proportions sum to 100% and confidence ratings reflect my analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses behavioral theory and public health frameworks, indicating Behavioral Economics (T8) and Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses the intersection of data protection and marital relationships. It mentions the use of data encryption, secure communication channels, two-factor authentication, and data security audits. The study uses correlational analysis of survey data from 500 couples, looking at how these data protection practices affect trust, emotional safety, commitment, and intimacy in marriages.\n\nNow, I'll go through each topic in the codebook to see which ones apply.\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models. It's more about data protection practices rather than machine learning applications. So, T1 is not present.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: This topic relates to meeting present needs without compromising the future, focusing on areas like renewable energy, climate change, etc. The abstract doesn't touch on environmental or sustainable development issues. So, T7 isn't relevant here.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: This field studies how psychological and social factors influence economic decisions. The abstract discusses trust, commitment, and intimacy, which are social and psychological factors. However, it doesn't frame these in an economic context or discuss decision-making processes in economic terms. Therefore, T8 might not be the best fit.\n\n4. **Digital Security (T9)**: This topic covers protecting data from breaches and unauthorized access, which is central to the abstract. The study focuses on data encryption, secure communication, two-factor authentication, and security audits\u2014all key aspects of digital security. The abstract extensively discusses these practices and their impact on relationships, making T9 the primary topic.\n\n5. **Public Health (T10)**: This involves protecting and improving population health through policies and research. The abstract doesn't address public health issues, epidemics, or health systems. So, T10 isn't applicable.\n\nFrom this analysis, the only topic clearly present is T9 (Digital Security). The abstract doesn't discuss other topics like machine learning, sustainable development, behavioral economics, or public health. Therefore, the proportion for T9 is 100%, and my confidence is high at 5.\n\nNext, looking at subtopics under T9: the abstract mentions data encryption, secure communication, two-factor authentication, and data security audits. These correspond to \"Cybersecurity\" and \"Threat Detection\" as subtopics. However, since the codebook lists subtopics under each topic, I need to map these correctly. The subtopics under T9 are \"Cybersecurity,\" \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies,\" \"Authentication Methods,\" \"Threat Detection,\" and \"Security Policy.\" The abstract touches on \"Authentication Methods\" (two-factor authentication) and \"Cybersecurity\" practices like encryption and secure communication. Therefore, both subtopics are relevant.\n\nI'm confident about these subtopics because they are explicitly mentioned in the abstract. So, each subtopic gets a confidence rating of 5.\n\nIn summary, the abstract focuses entirely on Digital Security (T9), with subtopics in Cybersecurity and Authentication Methods. Other topics from the codebook aren't present, so they aren't included.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on data protection practices within marital relationships, which falls under Digital Security (T9). The discussion of data encryption, secure communication, two-factor authentication, and security audits directly relates to the subtopics of Cybersecurity and Authentication Methods. No other topics from the codebook are present in the abstract.\"\n}\n```",

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided an abstract and wants me to code it using a predefined codebook. They want both topics and subtopics identified, along with proportions and confidence levels. \n\nFirst, I'll read the abstract carefully. It talks about marriage, confidentiality, well-being, encryption protocols, and disease prevention. The study uses correlational methodology and regression analysis. \n\nLooking at the codebook, the topics are Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, and Public Health. The abstract mentions encryption protocols and secure communication channels, which fall under Digital Security. So, I think T9 is a topic here.\n\nThe study also discusses disease prevention and health implications, which relates to Public Health (T10). The findings about disease incidence and prevention strategies are key points, so T10 is definitely present.\n\nNow, for proportions. The abstract spends about 60% discussing Digital Security, focusing on encryption and its effects. The remaining 40% is about Public Health, covering disease prevention and health check-ups. \n\nConfidence-wise, I'm pretty sure about Digital Security (T9) with a 5/5 confidence. Public Health (T10) is also clear, so 4/5 confidence there.\n\nFor subtopics, under Digital Security, the abstract specifically mentions encryption, so \"Cybersecurity\" is a subtopic. In Public Health, the study talks about disease prevention, so that's another subtopic. Both have high confidence, 5/5 each.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other topics. The abstract doesn't mention Machine Learning methods, so T1 isn't applicable. Sustainable Development and Behavioral Economics aren't discussed either. \n\nSo, the final coding includes T9 and T10 as topics, with their respective proportions and confidences. The subtopics are \"Cybersecurity\" and \"Disease Prevention.\" \n\nI think that's all. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure it's valid and follows the required format.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the implementation of advanced encryption protocols (Digital Security) and its relationship to disease prevention (Public Health).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the childcare sector facing challenges from environmental degradation and disease outbreaks. It's an observational study looking at the connection between energy systems and disease patterns in childcare facilities. The study finds that fossil fuels lead to higher rates of respiratory illnesses, while clean energy reduces disease prevalence. It also mentions improved indoor air quality and cognitive development in facilities using renewable energy. The implications suggest a shift towards clean energy to mitigate environmental hazards and reduce disease burden.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the study is about the impact of energy sources on health outcomes. The main areas discussed are energy systems (fossil fuels vs. clean energy) and their effects on disease patterns. This seems to fall under Sustainable Development (T7) because it's dealing with environmental issues and their impact on public health, aiming for sustainable solutions.\n\nLooking at the subtopics under T7, the abstract mentions renewable energy and clean energy, which directly relate to \"Renewable Energy.\" It also discusses disease patterns and their reduction, which ties into \"Environmental Monitoring\" as the study is monitoring how energy sources affect health metrics.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Digital Security (T9). The focus is on environmental and health aspects, not technology or policy frameworks beyond the recommendation for clean energy adoption.\n\nFor the proportion, the entire abstract is centered around Sustainable Development, so it's 100%. As for confidence, I'm very certain about T7 being the main topic.\n\nRegarding subtopics, \"Renewable Energy\" is clearly discussed, and \"Environmental Monitoring\" is implied through the study's observational approach. Both are confidently identified, so I'll rate them as 5 each.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The study is about Sustainable Development (topic) and specifically looks into Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring (subtopics). There's no overlap with other topics like Public Health (T10) because the focus isn't on the public health methodologies but rather the environmental impact on health outcomes.\n\nSo, the final analysis is that the abstract is entirely about Sustainable Development (T7) with subtopics Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the relationship between energy systems and disease patterns in childcare facilities, emphasizing the transition to clean energy.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the intersection of energy systems and infectious disease dynamics within childcare settings. It mentions challenges related to energy systems, indoor air quality, and respiratory infections. The study uses observational analysis of childcare centers, looking at energy sources, air quality metrics like PM2.5 and VOCs, and the impact on health outcomes.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for topics:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract talks about transitioning to low-carbon economies, renewable energy systems, energy efficiency, and green spaces. These are all directly related to sustainable development, specifically the subtopics of Renewable Energy, Resource Management, and Environmental Monitoring.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: The study examines infectious disease dynamics, respiratory infections, and health outcomes in childcare settings. This falls under public health, particularly the subtopics of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.\n\nI don't see evidence of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Digital Security (T9) in the abstract. The focus is on the intersection of energy and health, not on methodologies like machine learning or cybersecurity.\n\nNext, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing energy systems, renewable energy, and their impact on the environment, which seems to be about 60%. The other 40% is about health outcomes, disease prevention, and public health implications.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract clearly mentions Renewable Energy (T7), Resource Management (T7), and Environmental Monitoring (T7) under Sustainable Development. Under Public Health, it touches on Disease Prevention (T10) and Health Promotion (T10).\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly discusses these areas. The use of terms like \"renewable energy systems,\" \"indoor air quality,\" and \"respiratory infections\" directly aligns with the subtopics listed in the codebook.\n\nI don't think there are any overlapping terms that could cause confusion between topics. The focus is clearly on the environmental and health aspects within childcare settings, making Sustainable Development and Public Health the most relevant topics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the intersection of energy systems and infectious disease dynamics within childcare settings, focusing on sustainable development aspects like renewable energy and resource management, and public health aspects like disease prevention and health promotion.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that looks at how cognitive biases, perceived uncertainty, and physical activity engagement are related. It mentions using a Bayesian approach to model risk perceptions and exercise choices. The study involved a laboratory experiment with participants making decisions under varying levels of uncertainty about exercise efficacy. The findings suggest that underestimating uncertainty leads to more physical activity, while overestimating it results in risk-averse behavior. The implications are for health promotion strategies and policy interventions.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the study is about how people make decisions regarding health, specifically physical activity. This seems to fall under Behavioral Economics (T8) because it deals with how psychological factors influence economic decisions. The abstract mentions cognitive biases and risk perceptions, which are subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8's subtopics include Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, etc.).\n\nNext, the study's implications are for health promotion and policy, which relates to Public Health (T10). The abstract talks about designing effective health promotion strategies and policy interventions, which are subtopics under Public Health, such as Health Promotion and Health Systems.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), or Digital Security (T9). The methods used, like Bayesian modeling, are more about the analysis rather than indicating a topic like Machine Learning.\n\nSo, the two main topics are Behavioral Economics (T8) and Public Health (T10). For proportions, since the abstract is more about the decision-making process (Behavioral Economics) and then discusses the implications for public health strategies, I'd estimate T8 at 60% and T10 at 40%.\n\nFor subtopics, Cognitive Biases and Decision Making are clearly present. The study also touches on Risk Assessment, as participants are assessing the risks of different exercise regimens. Health Promotion and Health Systems are mentioned in the context of policy implications.\n\nI'm confident about T8 and T10, so their confidence ratings are 5. The subtopics are well-supported, so their confidence is also 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Systems\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cognitive biases and decision-making processes in the context of health-related decisions, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on how choice architectures influence physical activity participation. It mentions using principles from behavioral economics and epidemiological insights. The experiments involve manipulating choice architecture elements like rewards, penalties, and default options. The findings show significant effects on physical activity levels. The study also highlights the role of cognitive biases, such as the availability and affect heuristics, in shaping decisions. The implications are for public health and exercise science, suggesting a multidisciplinary approach.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract heavily discusses behavioral economics, specifically how choice architecture and cognitive biases influence decisions. This aligns with Topic T8: Behavioral Economics. The subtopics mentioned include Decision Making and Cognitive Biases, both of which are subtopics under T8.\n\nAdditionally, the study's implications are for public health, which is Topic T10. The abstract mentions the impact on physical activity and the need for evidence-based interventions, which falls under Public Health.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, or Digital Security, so those topics aren't relevant here.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends about 60% discussing Behavioral Economics (T8) and 40% on Public Health (T10). The confidence for T8 is high (5/5) because the abstract extensively covers behavioral economics concepts. For T10, the confidence is moderate (4/5) since while public health is mentioned, the focus is more on the behavioral aspects.\n\nRegarding subtopics, Decision Making and Cognitive Biases are clearly discussed, so their confidence is high (5/5 each). There's no mention of other subtopics like Risk Assessment or Social Preferences, so they aren't included.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily deals with Behavioral Economics and its subtopics, with a secondary focus on Public Health.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses Behavioral Economics (T8) through its focus on choice architecture, decision-making, and cognitive biases.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of advanced analytics, specifically machine learning, in sports performance enhancement. It mentions the use of machine learning algorithms to identify optimal training regimens, improve endurance, and reduce injury rates. Additionally, it talks about how these analytics can enhance team cohesion and communication by facilitating data-driven decisions.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topic that stands out is \"Machine Learning\" (T1). The abstract explicitly mentions machine learning algorithms and their application in sports. There's no mention of other topics like Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, or Public Health. Therefore, T1 is the only topic present.\n\nFor the proportion, the entire abstract revolves around machine learning, so it's 100%. My confidence is high, so I'll rate it a 5.\n\nNow, for subtopics under T1, the abstract specifically mentions machine learning algorithms, which fall under the broader category of Machine Learning. However, it doesn't delve into more specific subtopics like Neural Networks or Supervised Learning. Therefore, the subtopic here is \"Machine Learning\" itself, but since it's the main topic, I might need to clarify if it's a subtopic or just the topic. Given the codebook, the subtopics are more specific, so perhaps \"Machine Learning\" isn't a subtopic but the main topic. Wait, the codebook lists subtopics under each main topic. Since the abstract doesn't specify a particular subtopic like Supervised Learning, I might not have enough evidence to assign a subtopic. Alternatively, if the main topic is T1, then the subtopic could be the application of machine learning in sports, but that's not listed in the codebook. Therefore, I might not have a specific subtopic to assign, but since the abstract does mention machine learning, perhaps it's best to note it as the main topic without a subtopic. However, the codebook expects subtopics, so maybe I should consider that the application itself is a subtopic, but it's not explicitly listed. Alternatively, perhaps the subtopic isn't applicable here, but the guidelines require identifying subtopics if present. Since the abstract doesn't specify a particular subtopic, I might have to leave it as just the main topic. But the codebook expects subtopics, so maybe I should note that no specific subtopic is mentioned beyond the main topic. Alternatively, perhaps the application in sports is a subtopic, but it's not listed. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. I think the best approach is to identify the main topic as T1 with high confidence and note that while machine learning is discussed, the subtopic isn't explicitly detailed beyond the main topic. Therefore, I might not assign a specific subtopic, but the codebook requires subtopics, so perhaps I should consider that the subtopic is the application of machine learning in sports, but since it's not listed, I might have to leave it as just the main topic. Alternatively, maybe the subtopic is the use of machine learning algorithms, which is a general subtopic under T1. Looking back, the codebook lists subtopics like Neural Networks, etc., but the abstract doesn't specify any of these. Therefore, I might not have enough evidence to assign a specific subtopic beyond the main topic. However, the codebook expects subtopics, so perhaps I should note that the subtopic isn't explicitly mentioned, but the main topic is clear.\n\nWait, the codebook's subtopics for T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. The abstract doesn't mention any of these, so I can't assign a specific subtopic. Therefore, I might have to note that the main topic is T1 with a high proportion and confidence, but no specific subtopic is identified beyond the main topic. However, the codebook expects subtopics, so perhaps I should consider that the subtopic is the application of machine learning in sports, but since it's not listed, I might have to leave it as just the main topic. Alternatively, perhaps the subtopic is the use of machine learning algorithms, which is a general application, but it's not listed as a subtopic in the codebook. Therefore, I might have to conclude that the main topic is T1 with a high proportion and confidence, and no specific subtopic is identified beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, but the codebook's subtopics are more specific. Since the abstract doesn't mention any of the specific subtopics, I can't assign any. Therefore, the main topic is T1 with 100% proportion and confidence 5, and no subtopics identified beyond the main topic. However, the codebook expects subtopics, so perhaps I should note that the subtopic isn't explicitly mentioned, but the main topic is clear.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtopic is the application of machine learning in sports, but since it's not listed, I can't assign it. Therefore, I'll proceed with identifying T1 as the main topic with 100% proportion and confidence 5, and no specific subtopics identified beyond the main topic. However, the codebook expects subtopics, so perhaps I should note that the subtopic isn't explicitly mentioned, but the main topic is clear.\n\nWait, the codebook's subtopics are specific methodologies under each topic. Since the abstract doesn't specify any of these, I can't assign a subtopic. Therefore, I'll proceed with T1 as the main topic and note that no specific subtopic is identified beyond the main topic.\n\nBut the codebook expects subtopics, so perhaps I should consider that the subtopic is the application of machine learning in sports, but since it's not listed, I can't assign it.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online platforms have created opportunities for information exchange but also introduced vulnerabilities to cyber threats. It talks about the relationship between information governance and environmental stewardship. The study uses a correlational approach to examine how environmental stewardship affects information governance. They analyze responsible resource allocation and its impact on information protection measures against cyber attacks.\n\nThe findings show that platforms prioritizing environmental stewardship have better information governance, with enhanced data encryption, access controls, and incident response. They mention environmentally conscious practices like energy-efficient data centers and e-waste reduction, which correlate with improved information security. The implications suggest integrating environmental considerations into information governance for more resilient online ecosystems.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are information governance, environmental stewardship, and their relationship with cyber threats and information security.\n\nStarting with the topics:\n\n1. **Digital Security (T9)**: The abstract extensively discusses cyber threats, information protection measures, data encryption, access controls, and incident response mechanisms. These are all directly related to Digital Security. The proportion here is significant, maybe around 60% since a large part of the abstract deals with these aspects.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The study focuses on environmental stewardship, resource allocation, and practices like energy-efficient data centers and e-waste reduction. These fall under Sustainable Development. This might take up about 40% of the abstract.\n\nNext, for subtopics:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring (T7.4)**: The abstract mentions environmental stewardship and practices that monitor and reduce environmental impact, which aligns with Environmental Monitoring. The confidence here is high.\n\n- **Cybersecurity (T9.1)**: The discussion on information protection, cyber attacks, and measures like data encryption and access controls directly relates to Cybersecurity. This is a clear subtopic with high confidence.\n\nI don't see mentions of other subtopics like Renewable Energy or Resource Management, so they aren't applicable here. The focus is on how environmental practices affect security measures, so only the two subtopics are relevant.\n\nIn terms of disambiguation, the abstract clearly distinguishes between the broader topics of Digital Security and Sustainable Development, with specific subtopics under each. The methodologies and terms used, like correlational approach and information protection, help in identifying the subtopics accurately.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the relationship between environmental stewardship and information governance, focusing on cyber threats and information security.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the impact of data governance strategies on network resilience in social media platforms. It mentions data encryption, access control, and the reduction of network downtime. It also talks about mitigating cyber threats and the importance of data governance policies.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or related methodologies. So, T1 is not present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) involves aspects like renewable energy, climate change, etc. The abstract doesn't touch on these areas, so T7 isn't relevant here.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) deals with decision-making, cognitive biases, etc. The abstract focuses on data governance and network resilience, not on human behavior or economic decisions. So, T8 isn't applicable.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is about protecting data and systems from threats. The abstract discusses data encryption, access control, and mitigating cyber threats, which are all part of digital security. This seems to be the main topic.\n\nPublic Health (T10) relates to health promotion, disease prevention, etc. The abstract doesn't address public health issues, so T10 isn't relevant.\n\nNow, focusing on Digital Security (T9), the subtopics include Cybersecurity, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Authentication Methods, Threat Detection, and Security Policy. The abstract mentions data encryption and access control, which fall under Privacy Enhancing Technologies. It also discusses mitigating cyber threats, which relates to Threat Detection. However, the primary focus is on data governance policies, which is a broader aspect of Digital Security rather than a specific subtopic.\n\nTherefore, the main topic is Digital Security (T9) with a high proportion of the abstract dedicated to it. The subtopics mentioned are Privacy Enhancing Technologies and Threat Detection, each with moderate confidence since they are mentioned but not the central focus.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses data governance and its impact on network resilience, which falls under Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about fostering prosocial behaviors in early childhood education. It mentions a multi-disciplinary framework combining cognitive psychology, environmental science, and computer-mediated communication. The study looks at how cognitive biases influence caregivers' decisions regarding environmental dilemmas. They use persuasive technologies to nudge caregivers towards more environmentally conscious choices, which also promotes prosocial behaviors among children. The interventions include eco-friendly defaults, social norms-based messaging, and real-time feedback, leading to reduced energy consumption and waste. The study's implications are for policy and practical interventions in sustainable development and social welfare in childcare.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the main topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract discusses prosocial behaviors, decision-making influenced by cognitive biases, and the use of persuasive technologies. This seems to fall under Behavioral Economics (T8), as it deals with how psychological factors influence decisions. The subtopics here would be Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n\nNext, the study aims to promote sustainable development through interventions in childcare settings. This clearly relates to Sustainable Development (T7). The subtopics here are Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities, as the interventions aim to reduce environmental impact and create sustainable environments.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on behavioral aspects and sustainability, not on algorithms, security measures, or public health policies.\n\nSo, the main topics are Behavioral Economics (T8) and Sustainable Development (T7). The proportions are roughly 60% for T8 and 40% for T7. The subtopics are Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities, each with high confidence since they are explicitly discussed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the influence of cognitive biases and decision-making processes in the context of environmental dilemmas, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that integrates frameworks from behavioral science, energy policy, and cybersecurity. It examines how cognitive biases, energy-efficient practices, and cyber threats affect childcare institutions. The research questions focus on the influence of energy-efficient practices on cognitive biases, the integration of frameworks to enhance resilience, and the implications for sustainability and cybersecurity.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models. So, T1 is not present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract talks about energy-efficient practices and long-term sustainability, which are part of Sustainable Development. The subtopics under T7 include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. The abstract mentions energy-efficient practices, which fall under Resource Management. So, T7 is present with a subtopic.\n\nThen, Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract discusses cognitive biases and decision-making, which are core to Behavioral Economics. The subtopics include Decision Making and Cognitive Biases. The study's questions and findings revolve around these aspects, so T8 is definitely present with its subtopics.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is mentioned in the context of cybersecurity threats and resilience. The abstract talks about cyber threats and enhancing security, which falls under Digital Security. The subtopics include Cybersecurity, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, etc. The abstract specifically mentions cybersecurity, so T9 is present with its subtopic.\n\nPublic Health (T10) doesn't seem to be addressed here. The focus is on energy, behavior, and security, not health-related topics.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract heavily discusses Behavioral Economics and Digital Security, each taking about 30% each. Sustainable Development is also significant, taking around 25%. The remaining 15% covers other aspects not directly tied to the main topics.\n\nFor confidence, I'm very confident about T8 and T9 since they are central. T7 is also clear, but maybe a bit less so than the others.\n\nSubtopics identified are Cognitive Biases under T8 and Cybersecurity under T9. Both are explicitly mentioned and central to the study.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any other topics or subtopics from the codebook present in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses Behavioral Economics (T8) through cognitive biases and decision-making, Digital Security (T9) via cybersecurity threats, and Sustainable Development (T7) through energy-efficient practices.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the distribution of resources in childcare settings and its impact on disadvantaged populations. It mentions developing a framework that uses advanced data analytics and threat mitigation strategies. They used a mixed-methods approach, combining large datasets with qualitative interviews. The results include anomaly detection algorithms and expert-derived rules, showing significant improvements in identifying high-risk cases and reducing security breaches. The implications are for policymakers and practitioners to create more equitable and secure environments.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the use of data analytics and algorithms points towards Machine Learning (T1). The mention of anomaly detection and algorithms are specific to this field. So, T1 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the framework's goal is to create more equitable and secure childcare ecosystems, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). The focus on resource distribution and improving well-being aligns with T7's subtopics like Resource Management and Environmental Monitoring, though the latter isn't explicitly mentioned.\n\nThe abstract also talks about integrating data analytics with stakeholder insights, which could touch on Behavioral Economics (T8), but there's no mention of decision-making, biases, or similar concepts. So, T8 might not be applicable here.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is present because of the threat mitigation strategies and the threat assessment module. The reduction in security breaches is a clear indicator of T9.\n\nPublic Health (T10) isn't directly addressed since the focus is more on resource distribution and security rather than health outcomes or epidemiology.\n\nFor subtopics under T1, the use of anomaly detection algorithms falls under Supervised Learning, as it's a method within Machine Learning. The integration of expert-derived rules might relate to Transfer Learning, but it's a bit of a stretch. However, the primary subtopic here is Supervised Learning.\n\nUnder T7, the framework aims to improve resource distribution and well-being, which fits under Resource Management. There's no explicit mention of Renewable Energy or Climate Change, so Resource Management is the most appropriate subtopic.\n\nFor T9, the threat assessment module and strategies point towards Threat Detection, a subtopic within Digital Security.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The abstract spends a significant portion discussing the data analytics and algorithms, so T1 might take up about 40%. T7 is about creating equitable systems, which is a major focus, so maybe 35%. T9, dealing with security, is about 25%. Adding up, that's 100%.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about T1 and T9, so 5 each. T7 is a bit less direct but still relevant, so 4.\n\nSubtopics: Supervised Learning is clearly mentioned, so confidence 5. Resource Management is a good fit, confidence 4. Threat Detection is directly addressed, confidence 5.\n\nI think that covers all the relevant points. I don't see any other subtopics from the codebook that fit here. The abstract doesn't mention anything related to Behavioral Economics or Public Health beyond the broader Sustainable Development context.\n\nSo, to summarize, the topics are T1, T7, and T9 with their respective proportions and confidences. The subtopics are Supervised Learning, Resource Management, and Threat Detection, each with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of advanced data analytics and anomaly detection algorithms, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

The first thing I notice is the mention of machine learning and predictive models. That clearly points to the Machine Learning topic, specifically under T1. The abstract talks about using these models to enhance risk assessments, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning, so Supervised Learning makes sense here.\n\nThen, the study's context is about informal childcare and improving care quality, which falls under Public Health, T10. They discuss policy implications and interventions, which are subtopics like Health Promotion and Disease Prevention. \n\nI don't see any mentions of Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, or Digital Security. The focus is on applying machine learning in a public health context, so those other topics aren't relevant here.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends a good chunk discussing machine learning methods and their integration, so I'd say around 60%. The rest, about 40%, is about the public health implications and policy applications.\n\nConfidence is high for both topics because the abstract explicitly mentions machine learning techniques and their application in public health. The subtopics are directly related to the methods and outcomes discussed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of machine learning models with traditional risk assessment frameworks, clearly indicating the Machine Learning (T1) topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of a theoretical framework that combines insights from behavioral science and artificial intelligence to develop adaptive interventions for fostering resilient marriages. It mentions principles from decision theory and behavioral economics, and it uses concepts like contextual bandits, which is a machine learning technique.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll identify the topics. The abstract heavily discusses the application of machine learning concepts, specifically contextual bandits, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). It also delves into behavioral economics, referencing decision theory and behavioral economics principles, which corresponds to Behavioral Economics (T8). There's no mention of sustainable development, digital security, or public health, so those topics aren't present.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing machine learning techniques and their application, which I'd estimate at about 60%. The remaining 40% is dedicated to behavioral economics, particularly in the context of decision-making processes and interventions.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract specifically mentions contextual bandits, which is a subtopic. Under Behavioral Economics (T8), the abstract discusses decision-making processes, which is another subtopic.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly mentions the methodologies and concepts related to these topics and subtopics. There's a clear focus on how machine learning techniques are applied to behavioral economic principles to develop interventions for marital relationships.\n\nI don't see any overlap or ambiguity in the terminology used, so the topics and subtopics are distinct and clearly identifiable.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically contextual bandits, which falls under the broader topic of Machine Learning (T1).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that proposes a framework called 'SupportNet' to enhance spousal support, which is linked to marital satisfaction and stability. It integrates insights from social epidemiology and artificial intelligence. The framework uses reinforcement-based algorithms and machine learning techniques to model and influence support exchange between partners. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining survey data with machine learning algorithms. The findings suggest that SupportNet can identify high-risk couples and provide targeted interventions, leading to improved relationship satisfaction. The methodology includes a randomized controlled trial with a large sample size. The study's implications are discussed for clinicians, policymakers, and researchers, and future directions are mentioned.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the codebook to identify the relevant topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, looking at the topics:\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract mentions the use of machine learning algorithms, reinforcement-based algorithms, and data-driven techniques. These are central to the framework's development and application. The study's methodology and findings heavily rely on machine learning techniques, indicating a significant portion of the abstract is dedicated to this topic.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: The abstract references social epidemiology, which is a subfield of public health. The study's focus on spousal support and its impact on marital satisfaction touches on public health themes, particularly in the context of social support and its implications for population health. However, this seems to be a supporting aspect rather than the primary focus.\n\nNext, considering the subtopics under each identified topic:\n\n- Under **Machine Learning (T1)**, the subtopic **Reinforcement Learning** is explicitly mentioned as part of the algorithms used in the framework. This is a clear subtopic within the broader Machine Learning category.\n\n- Under **Public Health (T10)**, the subtopic **Epidemiology** is relevant because the study uses insights from social epidemiology, which is a branch of epidemiology. However, the abstract doesn't delve deeply into traditional epidemiological methods beyond mentioning it as a source of insights.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic:\n\n- **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract extensively discusses the use of machine learning techniques, algorithms, and data-driven methods. This seems to be the primary focus, covering about 60% of the content.\n\n- **Public Health (T10)**: While social epidemiology is mentioned, the discussion is more about the application of machine learning in this context. Therefore, public health might account for about 40% of the abstract, but it's more of a supporting role.\n\nFor confidence ratings:\n\n- **Machine Learning (T1)**: High confidence (4/5) because the abstract clearly and repeatedly discusses machine learning techniques and their application.\n\n- **Public Health (T10)**: Moderate confidence (3/5) because while social epidemiology is mentioned, the focus is more on the machine learning aspects rather than public health methodologies.\n\nRegarding subtopics:\n\n- **Reinforcement Learning**: High confidence (4/5) as it's explicitly mentioned as part of the framework.\n\n- **Epidemiology**: Moderate confidence (3/5) because it's mentioned in the context of social epidemiology, but the focus isn't on epidemiological methods per se.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics and subtopics. The main topic is Machine Learning, with Public Health being a secondary topic. The subtopics are specific areas within these topics that are addressed in the abstract.\n\nI should also check if any other subtopics from the codebook are relevant.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about urbanization and ecological degradation. It discusses how advertisers influence consumer behavior, specifically in making environmentally conscious decisions. They mention using cognitive nudges, availability heuristic, and affect heuristic. The study looks at how these strategies can change consumer preferences towards eco-friendly products and increase willingness to adopt sustainable practices.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the main topics. The abstract is about how advertising strategies influence consumer behavior in the context of environmental sustainability. This seems to fall under Behavioral Economics because it's discussing how cognitive biases and heuristics affect decision-making. There's also a focus on sustainable development, particularly in urban planning and consumer behavior related to the environment.\n\nSo, the two main topics are Behavioral Economics (T8) and Sustainable Development (T7). \n\nFor Behavioral Economics, the abstract discusses decision-making influenced by cognitive biases like the availability and affect heuristics. These are subtopics under T8. The study's focus on how these biases affect consumer choices is a significant part of the abstract, so I'd estimate about 60% of the content relates to T8.\n\nSustainable Development is also a key topic because the study is about promoting eco-friendly practices and sustainable urban planning. The abstract mentions advertisers influencing consumers to adopt sustainable alternatives, which ties into sustainable development. I'd say about 40% of the content is related to T7.\n\nNow, for subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions cognitive biases (availability heuristic and affect heuristic), which are subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8). These are explicitly discussed in the context of how advertising strategies influence consumer behavior. So, the subtopic here is \"Cognitive Biases\" with high confidence.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from the codebook mentioned. The focus is on how these cognitive biases are used in advertising to promote sustainable choices, which ties back to both Behavioral Economics and Sustainable Development.\n\nIn terms of disambiguation, the abstract clearly discusses the role of cognitive biases in influencing consumer decisions, which is a subtopic of Behavioral Economics. At the same time, the broader context of sustainable development is present, but it's more about the application rather than a separate topic. Therefore, the main topics are T8 and T7, with the subtopic being \"Cognitive Biases.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the influence of cognitive biases (availability heuristic and affect heuristic) in advertising strategies, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how advertising influences consumer perceptions of environmental sustainability. It mentions cognitive biases, such as the availability heuristic and affect heuristic, which are exploited by advertisers. It also talks about eco-labels, greenwashing, emotional language in ads, digital technologies in advertising, transparency, and accountability.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for the presence of each topic. The abstract doesn't mention anything related to Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health. It's all about how cognitive biases affect consumer behavior in the context of advertising and sustainability. This clearly falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).\n\nNow, for subtopics under Behavioral Economics, the relevant ones are Cognitive Biases and Decision Making. The abstract explicitly discusses cognitive biases like the availability and affect heuristics, so that's a definite match. There's also a mention of how consumers make decisions based on emotional connections, which relates to Decision Making.\n\nI don't see any mention of other subtopics like Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, or Intertemporal Choice. The focus is on how biases influence perceptions and decisions, so only Cognitive Biases and Decision Making are applicable.\n\nI'm confident that Behavioral Economics is the main topic here, and the subtopics are well-supported by the content of the abstract. There's no overlap with other topics, so the identification is clear.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses cognitive biases and their impact on consumer decision-making in the context of environmental sustainability in advertising.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the impact of online platforms on human behavior, focusing on decision-making, social norms, resource management, and threat detection. It mentions a survey of 1,500 users and explores how individual values and social influence affect resource utilization. It also talks about threat detection through analyzing user interactions.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any algorithms, models, or techniques specific to ML. It's more about human behavior and decision-making, so T1 is probably not relevant.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract discusses resource management and sustainability, which are part of T7. The subtopics include Renewable Energy, Climate Change, etc., but the abstract doesn't delve into these specifics. So T7 is present but not the main focus.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) seems highly relevant. The study focuses on decision-making, social norms, and preferences, which are core to T8. The subtopics like Decision Making and Social Preferences are clearly addressed. This is a major topic in the abstract.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is mentioned in the context of threat detection and anomaly detection. The abstract talks about detecting suspicious activities, which relates to cybersecurity and threat detection, a subtopic of T9. However, this part is less detailed compared to the Behavioral Economics section.\n\nPublic Health (T10) doesn't seem to be present. There's no mention of epidemiology, health promotion, or related areas.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: Behavioral Economics is the most discussed, taking up about 60%. Digital Security is about 20%, and Sustainable Development is 20%. Public Health isn't present.\n\nFor subtopics, under Behavioral Economics, Decision Making and Social Preferences are clearly discussed. Under Digital Security, Threat Detection is mentioned. There's no mention of other subtopics like Cybersecurity or Privacy Enhancing Technologies.\n\nI'm confident about T8 and T9 being present, with T8 being the primary focus. The confidence for T7 is lower because it's mentioned but not in depth. The subtopics are well-supported by the content of the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Preferences\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses human decision-making influenced by social norms and preferences, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully to understand its main points.\n\nThe abstract discusses how increased reliance on online platforms affects digital interactions, influencing behavior. It mentions three main areas: online social dynamics, resource consumption patterns, and cyber threat detection strategies. The study uses a survey of over 1,000 participants to explore these relationships. Key findings include the impact of online interactions on resource usage, the correlation between social connections and susceptibility to cyber threats, and the potential of online platforms to promote sustainable resource management. The conclusion emphasizes the need for a multi-faceted approach integrating insights from various disciplines.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the codebook to see which topics and subtopics are relevant.\n\nFirst, looking at the topics:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract discusses resource consumption patterns, efficient resource utilization, and reducing environmental impact. These points directly relate to sustainable development, particularly the subtopics of Resource Management and Environmental Monitoring.\n\n2. **Digital Security (T9)**: The study addresses cyber threat detection strategies and the rise in cyber threats with increased online reliance. This falls under Digital Security, specifically the subtopic Cybersecurity.\n\n3. **Public Health (T10)**: While the abstract doesn't explicitly mention public health, it does discuss the impact of online interactions on behavior and resource use, which could have public health implications. However, this connection is less direct, so I'll rate it with lower confidence.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The majority of the content focuses on Sustainable Development and Digital Security, each taking about 40% of the abstract. Public Health is mentioned more tangentially, so I'll allocate 20%.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract clearly mentions Resource Management and Cybersecurity. There's a possible mention of Risk Assessment in the context of cyber threats, but it's not explicitly stated, so I'll include it with lower confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping with subtopics not explicitly mentioned. The abstract doesn't discuss other subtopics like Epidemiology or Health Promotion, so I'll stick to the ones clearly indicated.\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Sustainable Development and Digital Security, each with significant proportions, and a minor mention of Public Health. The subtopics are Resource Management and Cybersecurity, with a possible mention of Risk Assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses online social dynamics, resource consumption, and cyber threats, aligning with Sustainable Development (T7) and Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract using the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about human decision-making in social media, focusing on how psychological, environmental, and technological factors influence behavior. They mention using a laboratory science approach to study how people process ambiguous information online. They found that environmental cues, like virtual badges, affect risk perception and behavior. Framing of content, especially regarding climate issues, also impacts willingness to engage in sustainable practices.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8) because the study is about decision-making influenced by psychological factors. The abstract discusses how cues and framing affect behavior, which are aspects of decision-making and cognitive biases, both subtopics under T8.\n\nNext, there's a mention of environmental cues and sustainable practices, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). The study's implications are for promoting environmentally conscious behavior, which falls under T7's subtopics like Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities, but more directly relates to the broader topic.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract. The focus is on human behavior and environmental impact, so T1, T9, and T10 are not relevant here.\n\nFor proportions, the majority of the abstract discusses decision-making and psychological influences, so T8 would take up about 60%. The rest, around 40%, deals with environmental and sustainable aspects, so T7 gets 40%.\n\nAs for subtopics, the study specifically looks at how cues and framing influence decisions, which are examples of Decision Making and Cognitive Biases under T8. There's also a focus on environmental cues and sustainable behavior, which ties into Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities under T7.\n\nI'm pretty confident about T8 and T7 being the main topics, and their respective subtopics. The abstract clearly discusses decision-making processes and their impact on environmental behavior, so the confidence levels are high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses human decision-making influenced by psychological and environmental factors, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses an interdisciplinary study combining cognitive psychology, environmental science, and network analysis. The main focus is on how risk perceptions and information diffusion patterns influence online engagement with environmental issues. They conducted a mixed-methods approach, including a laboratory experiment and analysis of social media data.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for mentions of Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or related methodologies. So, T1 is likely not present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The study deals with environmental issues, risk perceptions, and promoting sustainable behaviors. This seems relevant. The abstract discusses environmental scenarios, online engagement, and the role of social influencers in promoting environmentally friendly behaviors. This aligns with Sustainable Development, particularly in areas like Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities, but more broadly, the study's focus is on influencing behaviors for sustainability.\n\nThen, Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract mentions cognitive biases, social influence, decision-making, and risk assessment. These are key subtopics under Behavioral Economics. The study looks at how these factors influence online behaviors related to environmental issues, which directly ties into T8.\n\nDigital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) don't seem to be addressed in the abstract. There's no mention of cybersecurity, privacy, health policies, or epidemiology.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The study is primarily about Behavioral Economics, as it delves into cognitive biases, decision-making, and social influence. Sustainable Development is also a significant part, focusing on environmental issues and online engagement strategies. I'd estimate T8 at 60% and T7 at 40%.\n\nFor subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8), the abstract mentions cognitive biases, decision-making, and risk assessment. These are all listed as subtopics. Under Sustainable Development (T7), the study touches on environmental monitoring (through social media analysis) and sustainable cities (though less directly, the focus is more on influencing behaviors for sustainability).\n\nI'm confident about T8 and its subtopics, so I'll rate them 5. For T7, while it's present, the focus is more on the behavioral aspects influencing sustainability, so I'll rate it 4.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while subtopics are the specific areas within them. The abstract clearly discusses elements of Behavioral Economics and Sustainable Development, with specific subtopics under each.\n\nSo, compiling this, the topics are T8 (60%) and T7 (40%). The subtopics are Cognitive Biases, Decision Making, Risk Assessment under T8, and Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities under T7. I'm confident about these identifications.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cognitive biases, decision-making, and risk assessment, which are subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about socioeconomic disparities and advertisement exposure. It mentions using predictive modeling as a tool to mitigate inequalities. They used a quasi-experimental design to examine the impact of targeted ads on marginalized populations. The study found that SES significantly influences ad exposure, with lower SES groups having less exposure to health-promoting ads. They used predictive modeling with advanced statistical techniques, showing that SES-based targeting can increase ad effectiveness and reduce health disparities. The implications suggest integrating predictive modeling into ad strategies for health equity.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the topics. The main areas discussed are socioeconomic disparities, advertisement exposure, predictive modeling, and public health implications. \n\nFirst, I think about Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions predictive modeling and advanced statistical techniques, which are part of Machine Learning. So, T1 is definitely present. The proportion here is about 30% because a significant part of the abstract discusses the modeling approach.\n\nNext, Public Health (T10) is another topic. The study focuses on health-promoting advertisements, health equity, and reducing health disparities, all of which fall under Public Health. This makes up about 50% of the abstract, as the majority of the discussion is about health outcomes and equity.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Digital Security (T9). The focus isn't on sustainability, behavioral aspects beyond socioeconomic factors, or digital security issues.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract specifically uses predictive modeling, which is a subtopic. So, \"Predictive Modeling\" is a subtopic here. Under Public Health (T10), the study discusses health equity and disease prevention, so \"Health Equity\" and \"Disease Prevention\" are relevant subtopics.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly mentions predictive modeling and statistical techniques, which tie directly to Machine Learning. Similarly, the focus on health outcomes and equity clearly falls under Public Health subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 50,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Predictive Modeling\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of predictive modeling (a subtopic under Machine Learning) and its application in understanding health equity and disease prevention (subtopics under Public Health).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses targeted advertisements as part of public health interventions to promote health equity. It mentions the use of a quasi-experimental framework and integrates machine learning with socio-economic data. The study's implications are for public health interventions, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions developing a predictive model using machine learning, specifically transfer learning. This indicates the presence of T1. The subtopics under T1 include Transfer Learning, which is explicitly mentioned.\n\nNext, Public Health (T10) is clearly present. The study focuses on health equity, public health interventions, and improving health outcomes. The subtopics under T10 include Health Equity and Health Promotion, both of which are discussed in the abstract.\n\nSustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem to be relevant here. The abstract doesn't mention anything about renewable energy, climate change, or resource management. Similarly, Behavioral Economics (T8) and Digital Security (T9) aren't addressed. The focus is on public health and machine learning, so these topics can be excluded.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing the application of machine learning in developing predictive models and transfer learning. However, the majority of the content is about public health interventions, their effectiveness, and implications. So, I'd estimate T10 (Public Health) at 60% and T1 (Machine Learning) at 40%.\n\nFor subtopics, Transfer Learning is clearly mentioned under T1. Under T10, Health Equity and Health Promotion are both discussed, as the study aims to improve health outcomes and reduce disparities.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications. The abstract explicitly uses terms like \"machine learning,\" \"transferable knowledge,\" \"health equity,\" and \"public health interventions.\" There's no ambiguity in linking these to the codebook topics and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of machine learning (T1) in developing a predictive model, specifically mentioning transfer learning as a subtopic.

The results show reductions in emissions, improved threat detection, and increased productivity.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract talks about minimizing ecological footprint, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). It specifically mentions eco-friendly practices and reducing carbon emissions, which fall under the subtopic of Renewable Energy or Climate Change Mitigation. However, since the codebook's subtopics for T7 include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, etc., I can identify Renewable Energy as a subtopic here.\n\nNext, the study addresses cyber threats and uses advanced threat detection systems. This clearly falls under Digital Security (T9), specifically the subtopic Threat Detection.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract discusses optimized wellness strategies and their impact on employee productivity. This relates to Public Health (T10), particularly the subtopic Health Promotion, as it's about improving well-being and productivity.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract covers all three topics fairly evenly, but Sustainable Development (T7) seems to have a slightly larger focus since it's about reducing emissions, which is a significant part of the study. So, I'll allocate 40% to T7, 30% to T9, and 30% to T10.\n\nFor confidence ratings, I'm quite certain about T7 and T9 because the abstract explicitly mentions eco-friendly practices and threat detection. However, the connection to Public Health (T10) is a bit more inferred through wellness strategies, so my confidence is a bit lower there.\n\nRegarding subtopics, Renewable Energy (T7) is directly mentioned, Threat Detection (T9) is clearly discussed, and Health Promotion (T10) is a good fit for the wellness strategies. My confidence in these subtopics is high, except maybe for Health Promotion, which I'm 80% confident about.\n\nI should also ensure that I'm not missing any other possible topics. The abstract doesn't mention Machine Learning or Behavioral Economics, so those aren't applicable here.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the subtopics with their confidence. I'll also include a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses eco-friendly advertising (T7 - Renewable Energy), cyber threats (T9 - Threat Detection), and wellness strategies (T10 - Health Promotion).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses an interdisciplinary study that combines low-carbon technologies, AI-driven risk assessment, and advertising strategies. It mentions renewable energy, carbon offsetting, and the development of an AI tool for risk assessment. The study's implications focus on sustainable practices and reducing environmental impact in advertising.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are T1 (Machine Learning), T7 (Sustainable Development), T8 (Behavioral Economics), T9 (Digital Security), and T10 (Public Health). \n\nFirst, T1 (Machine Learning) is present because the abstract talks about AI-driven risk assessment, which falls under Machine Learning. The subtopic here would be \"Risk Assessment\" from T8, but wait, no, the subtopics for T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. Wait, no, the subtopics for T1 are under Machine Learning, but the risk assessment is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics (T8). Hmm, I need to be careful here.\n\nWait, the codebook shows that T8's subtopics include Risk Assessment. So, the AI-driven risk assessment tool is a subtopic of T8, but the AI itself is part of Machine Learning (T1). So, both T1 and T8 are present.\n\nNext, T7 (Sustainable Development) is definitely present because the abstract discusses renewable energy, carbon offsetting, and minimizing environmental impact, which are all part of Sustainable Development. The subtopics here would be Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring, as the study evaluates environmental impact.\n\nT10 (Public Health) doesn't seem to be present because the abstract doesn't discuss health-related issues or public health policies. Similarly, T9 (Digital Security) isn't mentioned, and T8's other subtopics like Decision Making or Cognitive Biases aren't discussed beyond Risk Assessment.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The abstract spends a significant portion discussing Sustainable Development, especially in the context of renewable energy and environmental impact. Machine Learning is discussed in terms of the AI tool, which is a substantial part but perhaps less than Sustainable Development. Risk Assessment is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics, but since it's a part of the AI tool, it's a smaller portion.\n\nSo, I'd estimate T7 (Sustainable Development) at 40%, T1 (Machine Learning) at 35%, and T8 (Behavioral Economics) at 25%. \n\nFor subtopics, the AI-driven risk assessment tool is a subtopic of Behavioral Economics, specifically \"Risk Assessment.\" The abstract also mentions Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring as part of Sustainable Development.\n\nI'm confident about T7 and T1, but T8's presence is a bit less direct since it's through the risk assessment tool. So, confidence levels would be high for T7 and T1, and moderate for T8.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON structure should reflect these findings with the appropriate topic IDs, proportions, confidence levels, and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of low-carbon technologies (T7) and AI-driven risk assessment (T1 and T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the role of educational institutions in fostering a more resilient and equitable future by integrating ecological, social, and economic dimensions. It mentions principles of ecology, sociology, and economics, and talks about urban ecosystems, sustainability, and resilience. The study uses a mixed-methods approach and highlights specific interventions like green infrastructure, sustainable transportation, and circular economy principles.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract heavily discusses urban sustainability, ecological dimensions, resource management (like green infrastructure), and climate change mitigation (e.g., reducing urban heat islands and greenhouse gases). These are all subtopics under T7. The majority of the abstract is about integrating these dimensions, so T7 is definitely present with a high proportion.\n\nNext, I'll consider Public Health (T10). The abstract mentions the well-being of urban communities and health equity, which are subtopics under T10. However, these aspects are discussed more in the context of sustainability rather than being the primary focus. So, T10 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\nOther topics like Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, and Digital Security don't seem to be mentioned. The abstract doesn't discuss algorithms, decision-making biases, or security measures, so those can be ruled out.\n\nFor subtopics under T7, the abstract specifically mentions Renewable Energy (though not explicitly, green infrastructure could relate), Climate Change Mitigation (through reducing greenhouse gases), Resource Management (green infrastructure), Environmental Monitoring (though not directly, the study measures impacts), and Sustainable Cities (as the focus is on urban ecosystems). However, the most directly mentioned subtopics are Climate Change Mitigation and Resource Management.\n\nPutting it all together, the abstract is primarily about Sustainable Development (T7) with some elements of Public Health (T10). The subtopics are Climate Change Mitigation and Resource Management.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Climate Change Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses sustainable development through integrating ecological, social, and economic dimensions in educational institutions, which aligns with T7.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses the challenges of creating livable and resilient urban environments. It mentions the integration of various disciplines like ecology, architecture, sociology, and economics. The research employs a mixed-methods approach, focusing on urban planning, governance, green infrastructure, community engagement, circular economy principles, social equity, and public health outcomes.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the first topic I notice is Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract heavily emphasizes urban sustainability, environmental factors, resource management (like green infrastructure and circular economy), and social equity. These are all subtopics under T7. The proportion of the abstract related to Sustainable Development seems quite high, maybe around 70%.\n\nNext, I see elements of Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract talks about community engagement, participatory planning, and social equity, which relate to decision-making and social preferences within Behavioral Economics. However, these aspects are discussed in the context of urban planning and sustainability, so T8 might be a secondary topic with a proportion of about 20%.\n\nThere's also a mention of a mixed-methods approach, which could relate to Research Methods, but since that's not listed in the codebook, I won't consider it. Similarly, while Public Health (T10) is touched upon with public health outcomes, it's not a primary focus, so I won't include it unless it's more prominent.\n\nFor subtopics under T7, the abstract mentions green infrastructure (Environmental Monitoring), community engagement (which could relate to Environmental Monitoring or Resource Management), circular economy (Resource Management), and social equity (Environmental Monitoring). Under T8, community engagement and social equity fall under Social Preferences and Decision Making.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main focus is on Sustainable Development, with some elements of Behavioral Economics. The abstract doesn't delve into Machine Learning, Digital Security, or other topics from the codebook.\n\nSo, I'll structure the JSON response with T7 as the primary topic, T8 as a secondary, and list the relevant subtopics with their confidence levels. The disambiguation explanation should clarify how I distinguished between the main topic and the subtopics, ensuring that each is appropriately categorized based on the abstract's content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Preferences\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily focuses on sustainable urban development, which falls under the Sustainable Development (T7) topic.

The results show significant increases in preventive behaviors, and the effectiveness of messages that frame benefits in terms of future gains versus immediate costs.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The main areas here are the study of behavior change, decision-making, and the use of interventions. The topic \"Behavioral Economics\" (T8) seems relevant because it deals with how psychological and social factors influence decisions, especially in the context of risk and prevention. The abstract mentions influencing risk-taking behaviors and the effectiveness of different message framings, which ties into decision-making and cognitive biases within Behavioral Economics.\n\nNext, I consider if any other topics are present. The study doesn't explicitly mention Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health beyond the context of health interventions. So, T8 is the primary topic.\n\nFor subtopics, within Behavioral Economics, the abstract discusses decision-making and the framing of messages. The part about how messages emphasizing future gains were more effective points to \"Decision Making\" as a subtopic. There's also a hint at cognitive biases, but the focus is more on the decision-making process itself.\n\nI should also think about the proportion of the abstract related to Behavioral Economics. The entire study revolves around understanding and influencing decisions, so I'd estimate around 80% of the content. The remaining 20% might be methodological or general context, but not tied to another topic.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'm pretty sure about T8 being the main topic, so confidence is high. For the subtopic, \"Decision Making\" is clearly addressed, so confidence is also high there.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from other topics being relevant here. The study doesn't discuss cybersecurity, public health systems, or other areas. It's all about how people make decisions in response to online messages, which fits squarely under Behavioral Economics.\n\nSo, to summarize, the main topic is Behavioral Economics (T8) with a high confidence level and a significant portion of the abstract. The subtopic is \"Decision Making,\" also with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on how targeted online interventions influence risk-taking behaviors and decision-making related to infectious disease prevention. This aligns with Behavioral Economics (T8), particularly the subtopic of Decision Making, as it examines how individuals process information and make choices. The study's emphasis on the effectiveness of different message framings (e.g., future gains vs. immediate costs) further supports the relevance of Decision Making within Behavioral Economics.\"\n}\n```",

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online platforms have changed information dissemination. It focuses on temporal preferences and the spread of information, specifically looking at temporal discounting and its impact on user preferences. The study uses a quasi-experimental design, collecting data from social media users exposed to different temporal discounting cues. The findings show that higher temporal discounting leads to preferring immediate information, while lower discounting leads to more abstract, long-term information. Social influence also plays a role in moderating these effects. The implications are for online platform design and information dissemination strategies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract discusses temporal discounting, which is a concept within Behavioral Economics, particularly related to decision-making and cognitive biases. The study's focus on how users' preferences are shaped by temporal discounting and social influence aligns with Behavioral Economics.\n\nLooking at the subtopics under T8, the abstract mentions temporal discounting, which is a form of cognitive bias. Additionally, the study examines decision-making processes as users choose between immediate and long-term information. Therefore, the subtopics here are \"Cognitive Biases\" and \"Decision Making.\"\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is purely on behavioral aspects and decision-making in the context of information dissemination.\n\nFor the proportion, the entire abstract is centered around Behavioral Economics, so it's 100%. The confidence is high because the content directly relates to concepts within Behavioral Economics without ambiguity.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to Behavioral Economics as the primary topic with two relevant subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on temporal discounting and its impact on information preferences, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses systemic barriers in educational settings, particularly focusing on resource allocation within institutions. It mentions inequities, resource distribution, and its impact on student outcomes. The study uses a multi-disciplinary approach, incorporating concepts from sociology, economics, and education. It highlights power dynamics, institutional inertia, and policy decisions as factors perpetuating inequities. The findings emphasize how resource allocation patterns favor dominant groups and disadvantage marginalized ones, suggesting the need for policy interventions and reforms.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, considering the topics:\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any algorithms, models, or data-driven methods. It's more about social structures and policies, so T1 isn't relevant here.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: While the study deals with resource allocation, it's within an educational context, not environmental or economic sustainability. So, T7 doesn't fit.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The abstract discusses decision-making and resource allocation but doesn't delve into behavioral aspects like cognitive biases or risk assessment. It's more about structural and institutional factors, so T8 might not be the best fit.\n\n4. **Digital Security (T9)**: There's no mention of cybersecurity, privacy, or digital threats. This topic isn't relevant.\n\n5. **Public Health (T10)**: The study is about educational inequities, not health-related issues. So, T10 isn't applicable.\n\nWait, none of the topics seem to fit directly. The abstract is about educational inequities, resource allocation, and policy, which isn't explicitly covered in the provided codebook. The closest might be T8 (Behavioral Economics) if we consider decision-making, but it's not a perfect match. However, since none of the topics are directly applicable, I should note that no topics are present.\n\nFor subtopics, looking at each topic's subtopics:\n\n- T1's subtopics are all related to machine learning techniques, which aren't present.\n- T7's subtopics are about sustainability, which isn't relevant here.\n- T8's subtopics include Decision Making, which the abstract touches on in the context of resource allocation and policy decisions. However, since the main topic isn't clearly T8, the confidence is low.\n- T9 and T10's subtopics don't apply.\n\nSo, the only possible subtopic is \"Decision Making\" from T8, but with low confidence because the main topic isn't clearly Behavioral Economics.\n\nIn summary, the abstract doesn't align with any of the provided topics, but it does mention elements that could relate to the \"Decision Making\" subtopic, albeit weakly.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses resource allocation patterns and policy decisions, which touch on decision-making processes.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the relationship between educational settings and health outcomes, particularly focusing on disparities among students from different socio-economic backgrounds. It mentions interventions like school-based health education programs and policy changes promoting healthy food options. The study uses a mixed-methods approach and a theoretical framework called the social ecological model. It also highlights interdisciplinary collaboration between education, public health, and nutrition.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Public Health (T10) because the abstract deals with health outcomes, interventions, and disparities, which are central to public health. The study's focus on health education and policy changes aligns with public health strategies. The proportion of the abstract related to public health is significant, covering interventions, findings, and implications. I'll estimate about 60% of the abstract is about public health, with high confidence (4/5).\n\nNext, the abstract mentions the social ecological model, which is a framework used in public health but also touches on the broader aspects of education and environment. However, the primary focus is on health outcomes, so the main topic remains public health. There's a mention of interdisciplinary collaboration, which could relate to other fields, but the core discussion is within public health.\n\nLooking for subtopics under T10, the abstract discusses health disparities, which is a subtopic. The interventions and policies mentioned directly relate to health promotion and disease prevention, so those are relevant subtopics. The confidence for these subtopics is high (4/5 each).\n\nI don't see any clear mentions of Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Digital Security (T9). The focus is purely on public health aspects without delving into other domains.\n\nIn summary, the abstract is centered around Public Health (T10) with subtopics like Health Disparities, Health Promotion, and Disease Prevention. No other topics from the codebook are present in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Disparities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on health outcomes and interventions in educational settings, aligning with Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about marital dynamics and physical well-being. The study uses a survey of 1,200 couples to examine how spousal interactions affect chronic conditions. They found that emotional support and conflict resolution lower the risk of hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Also, there's a gender aspect: wives with more decision-making power have lower BMIs and less depression, while husbands with higher marital satisfaction have better sleep and less anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics from the codebook. The abstract is about how marital interactions influence health, which falls under Public Health (T10). It's looking at how social factors affect health outcomes, which is a key area in public health. The study's implications for interventions and disease prevention also tie into this topic.\n\nLooking at the codebook, other topics like Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), and Digital Security (T9) don't seem relevant here. The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, environmental sustainability, behavioral economic theories, or digital security issues.\n\nFor subtopics under Public Health (T10), the abstract discusses disease prevention (like reducing chronic conditions) and health promotion (through better marital dynamics). It also touches on health equity by suggesting interventions for different groups. However, the abstract doesn't mention epidemiology or health systems directly, so those subtopics aren't applicable.\n\nSo, the main topic is T10 with a high confidence level because the entire study is about public health aspects. The subtopics are Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, each with high confidence since they're central to the findings and implications.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the relationship between marital dynamics and physical health, which falls under the domain of Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that investigates how familial relationships, specifically spousal support and conflict, influence risk-taking behaviors among married individuals. It mentions the use of a survey administered to 1,200 married adults, assessing risk-taking behaviors, spousal support, and conflict. The findings indicate that higher spousal support is linked to lower risk-taking, while higher conflict is associated with higher risk-taking. There's also an interaction effect between support and conflict. The study's methodology draws from sociology, psychology, and epidemiology, using advanced statistical techniques.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are familial relationships, risk-taking behaviors, and the impact of social support and conflict. The methodologies include statistical analysis, but the primary focus is on the social and behavioral aspects.\n\nConsidering the topics in the codebook:\n\n- T1: Machine Learning \u2013 The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques or algorithms, so this isn't applicable.\n- T7: Sustainable Development \u2013 The study doesn't address sustainability, environmental issues, or resource management, so this isn't relevant.\n- T8: Behavioral Economics \u2013 This seems relevant because the study examines how social factors (support and conflict) influence individual risk-taking behaviors, which is a key area in behavioral economics.\n- T9: Digital Security \u2013 There's no mention of cybersecurity or digital practices, so this isn't applicable.\n- T10: Public Health \u2013 The study touches on risk-taking behaviors, which can have public health implications, and it mentions epidemiology in the methodology, so this is relevant.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The majority of the abstract discusses the relationship between familial relationships, support, conflict, and risk-taking behaviors, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). Public Health (T10) is mentioned in the context of implications for interventions and the use of epidemiology, but it's a supporting aspect rather than the primary focus. Therefore, T8 might take up about 70%, and T10 about 30%.\n\nFor subtopics, looking at T8's subtopics: Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, Intertemporal Choice. The study focuses on risk-taking behaviors influenced by social support and conflict, which relates to Risk Assessment and Social Preferences. However, the primary focus is on how social factors influence risk-taking, which aligns more with Risk Assessment. The abstract doesn't delve into cognitive biases or intertemporal choice, so I'll identify Risk Assessment as the subtopic with high confidence.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily discusses Behavioral Economics (T8) with a focus on Risk Assessment, and secondarily touches on Public Health (T10) with a lower proportion. The subtopic identified is Risk Assessment.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the influence of familial relationships, spousal support, and conflict on risk-taking behaviors, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses influenza outbreaks and their impact on global health. It mentions the development of a predictive framework using physiological signal analysis and historical pattern identification. The study uses data from wearable devices and historical influenza data, employing an algorithm to predict outbreaks up to four weeks in advance. It also highlights specific physiological signals like heart rate variability and skin conductance as indicators.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Public Health (T10) because the study is about preventing and controlling influenza outbreaks, which falls under public health initiatives. The abstract talks about surveillance, early warning systems, and targeted interventions, all of which are part of public health strategies.\n\nNext, the methods used in the study involve data analysis and predictive modeling. This points towards Machine Learning (T1), as the study employs an algorithm to integrate correlations and historical patterns. The use of a predictive framework suggests the application of machine learning techniques.\n\nNow, considering subtopics, under Machine Learning, the study uses a predictive algorithm, which could fall under Supervised Learning if the model was trained on labeled data. However, the abstract doesn't specify the type of learning used, so my confidence is moderate.\n\nFor Public Health, the study's focus on surveillance and early warning systems aligns with Epidemiology (a subtopic of T10). The analysis of data to predict outbreaks is a core aspect of epidemiological studies.\n\nI should also consider the proportions. The majority of the abstract discusses the public health implications, the development of the predictive framework, and its application in public health strategies. The technical aspects of the algorithm, while important, take up less space. So, I'll allocate about 60% to Public Health and 40% to Machine Learning.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics. The study's primary focus is on public health outcomes, using machine learning as a tool. Therefore, both topics are present but in different proportions.\n\nIn summary, the topics are T10 (Public Health) and T1 (Machine Learning). The subtopics are Supervised Learning (from T1) and Epidemiology (from T10). My confidence in these identifications is moderate to high, given the explicit mention of public health strategies and the use of an algorithm, though some aspects are inferred.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Epidemiology\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of a predictive framework for influenza outbreaks, which falls under Public Health (T10) due to its focus on disease prevention and control.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about chronic diseases and physical activity. The first thing I notice is that it's discussing public health issues, specifically chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The study is about how physical activity affects the risk of these diseases. That definitely falls under Public Health, which is T10 in the codebook. The abstract talks about interventions, risk factors, and policy implications, all of which are subtopics within Public Health. So, I'm pretty confident that T10 is a main topic here.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions using a machine learning approach to analyze a large dataset. They developed a predictive model using variables like physical activity levels and health outcomes. This clearly relates to Machine Learning, which is T1. The methods they used, like predictive modeling, are part of the broader Machine Learning topic. So, T1 is another main topic.\n\nNow, looking at the subtopics. Under Public Health, the study discusses chronic disease prevention and risk assessment. These are specific areas within Public Health, so those are the subtopics. For Machine Learning, they used a predictive model, which is a specific application within Machine Learning, so that's another subtopic.\n\nI need to estimate the proportion of the abstract each topic covers. Public Health seems to be the primary focus, discussing the impact of physical activity on chronic diseases and policy implications. So, maybe 60%. Machine Learning is used as a tool to analyze the data, so about 40%.\n\nI'm pretty confident about these identifications.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on how spouses' temporal preferences and decision-making processes affect their environmentally conscious and health-promoting behaviors. It uses frameworks from intertemporal decision-making, looking at how patience versus impulsiveness influences choices regarding energy, transportation, nutrition, health measures, and chronic disease management. The findings suggest that aligned temporal preferences lead to better adoption of sustainable and healthy behaviors, while mismatches cause conflicts. The study's implications include policy interventions and behavioral strategies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract heavily discusses decision-making processes, temporal preferences, and how these influence behaviors, which are all core aspects of Behavioral Economics. The study uses theoretical frameworks from intertemporal decision-making, which is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics (specifically, Intertemporal Choice). The focus on how psychological factors influence economic decisions (like environmental and health choices) also fits under Behavioral Economics.\n\nNext, the abstract also touches on Sustainable Development (T7). It discusses pro-environmental behaviors, renewable energy, and sustainability, which are subtopics under Sustainable Development, particularly Climate Change Mitigation and Resource Management. However, the discussion on Sustainable Development is more about the outcomes of the decision-making processes rather than the primary focus of the study.\n\nPublic Health (T10) is another topic mentioned, especially in the context of health-promoting behaviors, disease prevention, and health equity. The study examines how temporal preferences affect health-related decisions, which ties into Public Health subtopics like Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.\n\nNow, considering the proportions: Behavioral Economics is the most prominent, taking up about 60% of the abstract. Sustainable Development and Public Health each take about 20%, as they are significant but secondary focuses.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract clearly mentions Intertemporal Choice (T8's subtopic) as it's central to the theoretical framework. Additionally, the study touches on Decision Making (another subtopic under Behavioral Economics) as it examines how couples make joint decisions. Under Sustainable Development, the subtopics are Climate Change Mitigation and Resource Management, as the study discusses renewable energy and reducing waste. For Public Health, the subtopics are Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, as the study looks at health-related behaviors and interventions.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while subtopics are the specific areas within those fields. The abstract uses methodologies and frameworks from Behavioral Economics, making it the primary topic. The other topics are present but as applications or outcomes rather than the primary focus.\n\nSo, in summary, the topics identified are Behavioral Economics (T8), Sustainable Development (T7), and Public Health (T10), with proportions 60%, 20%, and 20% respectively. The subtopics are Intertemporal Choice, Decision Making, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Disease Prevention, and Health Promotion, each with high confidence as they are explicitly discussed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Intertemporal Choice\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Climate Change Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses decision-making processes and temporal preferences, which fall under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how individuals make decisions about their future, specifically in the context of long-term relationships. It mentions developing a theoretical framework that integrates insights from decision-making, marriage satisfaction, and health outcomes. The study looks at how temporal preferences influence health-promoting behaviors and marriage satisfaction. It also talks about intertemporal choice and the implications for interventions and policies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics match the content of the abstract.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract focuses on decision-making, temporal preferences, and intertemporal choice, which are all subtopics under Behavioral Economics. The study integrates insights from decision-making, which is a subtopic, and discusses how these factors influence health and marriage satisfaction. This aligns with the description of Behavioral Economics, which studies how psychological and cognitive factors influence economic decisions.\n\nNext, I consider if any other topics from the codebook are present. The abstract doesn't mention Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). The focus is purely on decision-making processes and their effects on personal outcomes, which fits under Behavioral Economics.\n\nFor the subtopics, the abstract explicitly mentions \"Decision Making\" and \"Intertemporal Choice.\" These are both listed under T8's subtopics. The study examines how temporal preferences (intertemporal choice) affect behaviors and satisfaction, which directly relates to these subtopics.\n\nI should also estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. Since the entire abstract revolves around decision-making and its implications, Behavioral Economics (T8) likely takes up about 80% of the content. The remaining 20% might be dedicated to the application of these concepts in understanding marriage and health outcomes, but since these are still within the Behavioral Economics framework, it's still under T8.\n\nI'm confident that Behavioral Economics is the correct topic here, and the subtopics are clearly present. There's no overlap with other topics from the codebook, so my confidence is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Intertemporal Choice\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on decision-making processes and their impact on health and marriage outcomes, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided an abstract and wants me to analyze it using a predefined codebook. They want me to identify the main topics and subtopics, estimate the proportion of the abstract each topic covers, and rate my confidence in each identification.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It's about applying advanced statistical models to optimize resource allocation in educational institutions. They mention using both quantitative and qualitative methods, including interviews and literature reviews. The study's findings include the effectiveness of predictive models and the impact of qualitative insights.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics. The main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). The abstract talks about statistical models, which could fall under Machine Learning, specifically supervised learning as a subtopic. However, the focus is more on the application in education rather than the technical aspects of ML.\n\nSustainable Development (T7) includes subtopics like Resource Management, which seems relevant here since the study is about resource allocation. The abstract discusses optimizing resources and improving efficiency, which aligns with Resource Management. Public Health (T10) doesn't seem directly related since the focus isn't on health outcomes or policies.\n\nSo, the main topics present are T1 (Machine Learning) and T7 (Sustainable Development). The abstract spends about 60% discussing Machine Learning, particularly the use of predictive models, and 40% on Sustainable Development, focusing on resource management in educational contexts.\n\nFor subtopics, the study uses predictive models, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning (Supervised Learning). Additionally, the emphasis on Resource Management from Sustainable Development is a key subtopic.\n\nI need to structure this into JSON format, ensuring that the topics and subtopics are correctly identified with their respective proportions and confidence levels. I'm confident about T1 and T7, so I'll rate them 4 and 5 respectively. The subtopics are clearly mentioned, so I'll rate them 4 each.\n\nFinally, I'll explain the disambiguation, noting that while Machine Learning is mentioned, the focus is on its application in resource management, which ties into Sustainable Development. This helps distinguish the primary topics from the subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of advanced statistical models (indicative of Machine Learning, T1) and their use in optimizing resource allocation (indicative of Sustainable Development, T7).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on context-aware recommendation systems in educational settings. It mentions the application of these systems to improve student outcomes, using a mixed-methods approach. The focus is on how these systems can personalize learning experiences, considering factors like data quality, system complexity, and user acceptance. It also highlights the roles of educators and administrators in implementing these systems.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics match the content of the abstract.\n\nFirst, I consider the main topics. The study is about recommendation systems, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any other topics like Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). So, the only topic present is T1.\n\nNext, I estimate the proportion of the abstract related to T1. The entire study is about recommendation systems, which are a part of Machine Learning. Since the abstract is entirely focused on this, I'll allocate 100% to T1.\n\nFor confidence, I'm very certain that Machine Learning is the correct topic here, so I'll rate it a 5.\n\nNow, moving on to subtopics. The abstract mentions context-aware recommendation systems, which are a type of recommendation system. In the codebook, under Machine Learning (T1), the subtopics include Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc., but context-aware recommendation systems don't directly match any of the listed subtopics. However, since the abstract is about recommendation systems, which are a part of Machine Learning, I can infer that it's related to the broader application of Machine Learning in this context. Therefore, the closest subtopic would be \"Machine Learning\" itself, but since it's a topic, not a subtopic, I might need to reconsider. Alternatively, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly listed, but the closest match is the application of Machine Learning in recommendation systems, which isn't a listed subtopic. However, since the codebook doesn't have a specific subtopic for recommendation systems, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is explicitly mentioned beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, the codebook's subtopics under T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. Since the abstract doesn't mention any of these, perhaps there's no specific subtopic identified. Alternatively, maybe the subtopic is not explicitly listed, so I might have to note that no subtopic is explicitly present beyond the main topic.\n\nBut looking back, the abstract does discuss the application of recommendation systems, which is a specific application within Machine Learning. However, since the codebook doesn't list recommendation systems as a subtopic, I can't assign a specific subtopic. Therefore, I might conclude that no subtopics are explicitly mentioned beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, but the codebook's subtopics under T1 are more about types of learning methods, not applications. Since the abstract is about the application of recommendation systems, which is a broader application of Machine Learning, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly covered in the codebook. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtopic is \"Recommendation Systems,\" but since it's not listed, I can't assign it. Therefore, I might have to say that no subtopics are explicitly present beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, but the codebook's subtopics under T1 are more about the types of learning (supervised, unsupervised, etc.), not the applications. So, since the abstract is about the application, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly covered. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nBut the user's example response included a subtopic, so perhaps I need to reconsider. Maybe the subtopic is \"Recommendation Systems,\" but since it's not listed, I can't assign it. Alternatively, perhaps the subtopic is \"Personalized Learning,\" but that's not listed either. Hmm.\n\nWait, the codebook's subtopics under T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. Since the abstract doesn't mention any of these, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly present. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nBut the user's example response included a subtopic, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine the abstract. It mentions context-aware recommendation systems, which are a type of recommendation system. Recommendation systems are a part of Machine Learning, but since the codebook doesn't list them as a subtopic, I can't assign a specific subtopic. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtopic is \"Recommendation Systems,\" but since it's not listed, I can't assign it. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, but the codebook's subtopics under T1 are more about the types of learning methods, not the applications. So, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly present. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nBut the user's example response included a subtopic, so perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the subtopic is \"Personalized Learning,\" but that's not listed. Alternatively, perhaps the subtopic is \"Educational Technology,\" but that's not in the codebook either.\n\nWait, the codebook's subtopics under T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. Since the abstract doesn't mention any of these, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly present. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtopic is \"Recommendation Systems,\" but since it's not listed, I can't assign it. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, but the codebook's subtopics under T1 are more about the types of learning methods, not the applications. So, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly present. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nBut the user's example response included a subtopic, so perhaps I'm missing something. Let me check the codebook again. The subtopics under T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning. The abstract doesn't mention any of these, so perhaps no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nTherefore, in the JSON response, I should list the topic as T1 with 100% proportion and confidence 5. For subtopics, since none are explicitly mentioned, I might have to note that no subtopics are present beyond the main topic.\n\nWait, but the user's example response included a subtopic, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding. Maybe the subtopic is \"Recommendation Systems,\" but since it's not listed, I can't assign it. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtopic is \"Personalized Learning,\" but that's not listed.

So, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly present. Therefore, I might have to note that no specific subtopic is present beyond the main topic.\n\nIn conclusion, the main topic is T1 with 100% proportion and confidence 5. No specific subtopics are present beyond the main topic.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on context-aware recommendation systems, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract describes a quasi-experimental study that uses adaptive pattern recognition systems in childcare settings. It mentions leveraging advanced computational models to develop a framework that identifies and responds to children's unique needs. The methodology involves collecting behavioral data to train and validate the system. The results show the system accurately identifies child behaviors and provides personalized feedback to caregivers, leading to improved interactions and child outcomes. The implications suggest applications in early childhood education, healthcare, and social services, and call for further research into adaptive systems.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are the use of computational models and pattern recognition, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). The study's application in childcare and its impact on caregiver-child interactions relates to Public Health (T10), specifically in improving child development and well-being.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract mentions computational models and pattern recognition, which are part of Machine Learning. However, the codebook's subtopics under T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. Since the abstract doesn't specify any of these, I can't assign a subtopic under T1. For Public Health (T10), the subtopics include Epidemiology, Health Promotion, etc. The study's focus on improving caregiver interactions and child outcomes aligns with Health Promotion and possibly Health Equity, but the abstract doesn't explicitly mention these. Therefore, I can't confidently assign a subtopic under T10 either.\n\nIn terms of proportions, the abstract spends about 60% discussing the computational models (Machine Learning) and 40% on the application in childcare (Public Health). My confidence in identifying Machine Learning is high (4/5), while Public Health is moderate (3/5) because the application is more about the context rather than the core focus.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The study's primary focus is on the application of Machine Learning techniques, making T1 the main topic. The context of childcare falls under Public Health, but it's more about the application rather than the core methodology, hence T10 as a secondary topic.\n\nI should also check if any other topics from the codebook are relevant. Sustainable Development (T7) isn't mentioned, nor are Behavioral Economics (T8) or Digital Security (T9). So, only T1 and T10 are relevant.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and note that no subtopics were explicitly mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of adaptive pattern recognition systems, which fall under Machine Learning (T1), and their impact on caregiver-child interactions, which relates to Public Health (T10).

The abstract explicitly mentions deep learning, CNNs, and predictive modeling, which are all subfields within Machine Learning. The discussion of the CNN's performance, including metrics like mean absolute error, further supports this. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, I consider the other topics. Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here since the abstract doesn't discuss environmental or resource management issues. Behavioral Economics (T8) is about decision-making and cognitive biases, which aren't the focus of this study. Digital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) also don't fit because the abstract is about education and predictive modeling, not security or health.\n\nNow, for subtopics under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract mentions deep learning and CNNs, which fall under Neural Networks. Transfer learning is also briefly mentioned as a future research direction. Therefore, the subtopics identified are Neural Networks and Transfer Learning.\n\nI should estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to Machine Learning. The entire study revolves around applying these models, so I'd say about 80%. The remaining 20% covers the educational context and implications, which don't fall under the predefined topics.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm very certain about the presence of Machine Learning and the subtopics mentioned. The abstract clearly outlines the use of these techniques, so my confidence is high.\n\nFinally, I need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The study's main focus is on the application of Machine Learning techniques (topic), specifically using deep learning and CNNs (subtopics), to improve educational interventions. There's no overlap with other topics like Sustainable Development or Public Health.\n\nSo, to summarize, the abstract primarily discusses Machine Learning with a focus on Neural Networks and Transfer Learning. No other topics or subtopics from the codebook are relevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which fall under the Machine Learning (T1) topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the online advertising industry, focusing on data protection and environmental sustainability. It mentions a study involving advertising professionals and consumers, looking at their practices and perceptions regarding data integrity and environmental impact. The findings highlight a disconnect between data protection and environmental practices, suggesting a need for a holistic approach.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for the topics:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract talks about environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and resource management. These are directly related to Sustainable Development. The study's focus on reducing the ecological footprint and promoting eco-friendly practices strongly indicates this topic.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: While the abstract doesn't explicitly mention health outcomes, it does discuss consumer trust and the impact of advertising on public perception. This relates to public health in terms of health promotion and health equity, as it touches on how advertising practices affect public trust and behavior.\n\nNext, for the subtopics:\n\n- **Environmental Monitoring (T7)**: The study discusses the ecological footprint and environmental impact, which fall under environmental monitoring. It's about assessing and mitigating environmental effects.\n\n- **Health Promotion (T10)**: The aspect of consumer trust and willingness to switch to eco-friendly brands relates to promoting healthier choices and behaviors, which is a subtopic of Public Health.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Digital Security in the abstract, so those topics aren't applicable here.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions:\n\n- Sustainable Development seems to take up about 60% of the abstract, as it's a central theme with detailed discussions on environmental practices and their impact.\n- Public Health, while present, is more about the implications on consumer trust and behavior, which is about 40% of the content.\n\nConfidence levels are high for both topics since the abstract clearly discusses these areas. For subtopics, Environmental Monitoring is directly supported by the content, and Health Promotion is a reasonable inference based on consumer behavior aspects.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping with the subtopics. The abstract doesn't explicitly mention health promotion, but the connection to consumer trust and behavior makes it a relevant subtopic under Public Health.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics and subtopics, their proportions, and confidence levels, along with a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses data protection and environmental sustainability in the context of online advertising, which aligns with Sustainable Development (T7) and Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the increasing reliance on online advertising and the associated vulnerabilities. It mentions a study that bridges cybersecurity and sustainable resource management by proposing a threat modeling framework. The methods include mixed-methods approaches, data collection from various stakeholders, and analysis of their concerns regarding cybersecurity and resource management. The findings highlight significant concerns about data breaches, malware, and inadequate resource allocation. The study contributes a framework integrating cybersecurity and resource management principles, aiming to enhance the security and sustainability of online advertising ecosystems.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are cybersecurity and resource management. Cybersecurity falls under Digital Security (T9), and resource management is part of Sustainable Development (T7). \n\nFor the proportion, the abstract spends about 60% discussing cybersecurity, detailing threats, data breaches, and the framework's integration. The remaining 40% covers resource management, discussing allocation strategies and sustainability aspects.\n\nRegarding confidence, both topics are clearly present, so I rate them 5 each.\n\nNext, identifying subtopics. Under Digital Security (T9), the subtopics mentioned are Cybersecurity and Threat Detection. The abstract talks about threat modeling, data breaches, and malware, which are directly related to Cybersecurity. Additionally, the framework's threat detection mechanisms are evident. For Sustainable Development (T7), the subtopic is Resource Management. The study addresses resource allocation strategies and their inadequacies, fitting this subtopic.\n\nI'm confident about these subtopics, so I rate each at 5.\n\nIn summary, the abstract covers both Digital Security and Sustainable Development, with their respective subtopics clearly present. The disambiguation explanation would clarify that the broader topics are identified based on the methodologies and areas studied, while the subtopics are the specific aspects within those broader areas.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cybersecurity threats and resource management in online advertising, clearly falling under Digital Security (T9) and Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about computational modeling to improve early childhood developmental assessments. They mention leveraging advanced computational architectures and a novel theoretical framework that integrates cognitive psychology, education, and computer science. The methodology includes probabilistic modeling and knowledge graph-based representation. They also discuss implications for policymakers and practitioners.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The codebook has five topics: Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nLooking at the abstract, the focus is on computational modeling and its application in early childhood assessments. The integration of computer science suggests a connection to Machine Learning (T1). The use of probabilistic modeling and knowledge graphs are techniques often associated with Machine Learning. So, T1 seems to be the primary topic here.\n\nNext, the abstract discusses the impact on early childhood development and interventions, which relates to improving public health outcomes. This points towards Public Health (T10). The mention of policymakers and practitioners also ties into public health systems and interventions.\n\nNow, checking the other topics: Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. Behavioral Economics (T8) isn't mentioned, nor is Digital Security (T9). So, the main topics are T1 and T10.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends a significant portion discussing computational modeling and its methods, which falls under Machine Learning. I'd estimate about 60% of the abstract is about T1. The remaining 40% discusses the application in early childhood development and policy implications, which falls under Public Health (T10).\n\nLooking at subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract mentions probabilistic modeling, which is a technique within Supervised Learning. So, Supervised Learning (T1) is a subtopic here. Additionally, the integration of multiple data sources and models could relate to Transfer Learning, another subtopic under T1.\n\nUnder Public Health (T10), the focus is on improving assessment tools and interventions, which falls under Disease Prevention. The discussion about equitable support and long-term outcomes also touches on Health Equity.\n\nI'm confident about T1 and T10 being the main topics, with their respective subtopics. The connection to Supervised Learning and Transfer Learning under T1 is clear, and Disease Prevention and Health Equity under T10 also fit well.\n\nI don't see any overlap or ambiguity with other topics, so the identification seems solid.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses computational modeling and machine learning techniques (T1) for early childhood assessments, with a focus on probabilistic modeling and knowledge graphs, which are subtopics under Supervised Learning and Transfer Learning.

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of data-driven decision-making in caregiver scheduling within childcare services. It mentions developing a context-aware scheduling framework using deep architectures, specifically a variant of recurrent neural networks. The methodology combines insights from artificial intelligence, computer science, and education. The results show improvements in scheduling efficiency and caregiver satisfaction.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll identify the topics. The abstract heavily focuses on the development and application of a deep learning model, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). The context is about caregiver scheduling, which relates to Public Health (T10) as it involves improving health services and caregiver well-being. There's no mention of sustainability, behavioral economics, or digital security, so T7, T8, and T9 are not present.\n\nNext, for subtopics under T1, the abstract specifically uses a recurrent neural network, which is a type of neural network.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let's start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about sedentary lifestyles in urban populations and strategies to promote physical activity. It mentions a mixed-methods study looking at individual, social, and environmental factors. They developed a framework and tested it with a pilot study. The results show increased physical activity and improvements in health. They used thematic analysis and regression analysis, highlighting the role of social support, urban planning, and policy interventions. The study emphasizes the need for a multi-faceted approach and suggests future research into scalability and technology-enabled interventions.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present.\n\nFirst, for TOPICS:\n\n1. **Public Health (T10)**: The abstract discusses promoting physical activity, which is a public health concern. It mentions chronic diseases, health equity, and interventions, all of which fall under Public Health. The study's implications are for designing interventions, which is a public health strategy. So, T10 is definitely present.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract touches on urban planning and policy interventions, which are aspects of sustainable development, particularly in the context of creating sustainable cities. However, the focus is more on health outcomes rather than environmental sustainability. So, T7 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The study looks at individual behavior and factors influencing physical activity, which could relate to decision-making and social preferences. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention behavioral economics terms or theories, so this might be a stretch. I'm not sure if it's strong enough to code T8.\n\n4. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or data analysis methods beyond regression analysis, which is a statistical method, not specifically ML. So, T1 isn't present.\n\n5. **Digital Security (T9)**: There's no mention of cybersecurity, privacy, or digital interventions beyond a brief note on technology-enabled interventions in future research. This is too vague to code T9.\n\nSo, the main topics are T10 (Public Health) and T7 (Sustainable Development). T10 seems to be the primary focus, with T7 being a secondary aspect.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion:\n\n- T10: The majority of the abstract discusses public health strategies, interventions, and health outcomes. Maybe 70%.\n- T7: Urban planning and policy are mentioned, but they're part of the broader public health context. Maybe 30%.\n\nNext, SUBTOPICS:\n\nLooking at the subtopics under each identified topic:\n\nUnder T10 (Public Health), the subtopics are:\n\n- Epidemiology\n- Health Promotion\n- Disease Prevention\n- Health Equity\n- Health Systems\n\nThe abstract discusses promoting physical activity (Health Promotion), preventing chronic diseases (Disease Prevention), and mentions health equity implicitly through the focus on urban populations. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention Health Equity or Health Systems. So, the subtopics present are Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.\n\nUnder T7 (Sustainable Development), the subtopics are:\n\n- Renewable Energy\n- Climate Change Mitigation\n- Resource Management\n- Environmental Monitoring\n- Sustainable Cities\n\nThe abstract mentions urban planning and policy interventions, which relate to Sustainable Cities. So, Sustainable Cities is a subtopic here.\n\nSo, the subtopics identified are:\n\n- Health Promotion (T10)\n- Disease Prevention (T10)\n- Sustainable Cities (T7)\n\nNow, confidence levels:\n\nFor T10, the abstract is clearly about public health interventions, so confidence is high (4/5). For T7, it's present but less central, so confidence is moderate (3/5).\n\nFor subtopics, Health Promotion and Disease Prevention are clearly discussed, so confidence is high (4/5 each). Sustainable Cities is mentioned but not in depth, so confidence is moderate (3/5).\n\nI need to make sure I'm not overstepping with T8 or T9 since they don't seem to fit well. The abstract doesn't discuss behavioral economics frameworks or digital security issues.\n\nSo, compiling all this, the JSON should reflect T10 and T7 as topics with their proportions and confidences, and the subtopics as identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses public health strategies and interventions, making T10 the main topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract describes a study on a novel, multimodal intervention to enhance physical activity adherence. It mentions a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data. The intervention includes personalized coaching, motivational interviewing, and wearable technology. The results show higher adherence in the intervention group, and qualitative data highlight the effectiveness of personalized coaching and wearable tech.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The study is about public health, specifically focusing on physical activity interventions. It discusses the development and evaluation of an intervention, which falls under Public Health (T10). The methods used, like mixed-methods, are part of the research methodology but don't tie directly to another topic in the codebook. There's no mention of machine learning, sustainable development, behavioral economics, or digital security beyond the use of wearable technology, which is a tool but not a primary focus.\n\nFor subtopics, under Public Health (T10), the relevant subtopic is Health Promotion, as the study aims to promote physical activity. The other subtopics like Epidemiology or Health Systems aren't discussed here.\n\nI'll estimate the proportion of the abstract related to Public Health. Since the entire study is about developing and evaluating a health intervention, I'll allocate 100% to T10. Confidence is high because the focus is clear.\n\nFor subtopics, Health Promotion is clearly addressed, so I'll rate it with high confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other topics. The use of wearable technology could relate to Digital Security (T9), but the abstract doesn't discuss security aspects, just the technology's role in monitoring. So, it's not a subtopic of T9.\n\nTherefore, the analysis should only include T10 with its subtopic Health Promotion.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on a public health intervention aimed at increasing physical activity adherence, which falls under the topic of Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that integrates data-driven decision support systems into educational institutions to improve student well-being. It mentions using a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data with qualitative insights. The framework uses advanced computational methods to optimize resource allocation. The findings show improvements in student well-being metrics, and the study emphasizes the potential for scaling the framework across different institutional contexts. It also highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration and advanced computational methods.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The main areas discussed are data-driven decision-making, computational methods, and their application in education. \n\nFirst, I consider \"Machine Learning\" (T1). The abstract mentions \"advanced computational methods,\" which could relate to machine learning techniques. However, it doesn't specify any particular subtopics like neural networks or supervised learning. So, while machine learning is a possible topic, the evidence isn't strong, so I'll rate it a 3.\n\nNext, \"Sustainable Development\" (T7) seems less relevant here. The focus is on educational institutions and student well-being, not environmental or resource sustainability. So, I'll exclude T7.\n\n\"Behavioral Economics\" (T8) involves decision-making influenced by psychological factors. The abstract talks about decision support systems but doesn't delve into behavioral aspects or cognitive biases. Therefore, T8 isn't directly applicable, so I'll exclude it.\n\n\"Digital Security\" (T9) deals with cybersecurity and privacy. The abstract doesn't mention security concerns or privacy issues, so T9 isn't relevant here.\n\n\"Public Health\" (T10) focuses on population health and well-being. The study's goal is to improve student well-being, which aligns with public health objectives. The methods used, like epidemiology and health promotion, are relevant. The abstract extensively discusses well-being outcomes and resource allocation, which are core to public health. So, T10 is definitely present with a high confidence rating of 5.\n\nFor subtopics under T10, the abstract mentions \"Epidemiology\" through the use of quantitative data and \"Health Promotion\" through the focus on improving well-being. These are explicitly discussed, so I'll include both with confidence ratings of 4 each, as they are clearly relevant but not the sole focus.\n\nIn summary, the main topic is Public Health (T10) with a significant portion of the abstract dedicated to it. Machine Learning (T1) is a possible secondary topic but with less evidence. The subtopics are Epidemiology and Health Promotion, both clearly present in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Epidemiology\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of data-driven decision support systems in educational settings to improve student well-being, which aligns with Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses using artificial intelligence techniques to enhance educational institutions' performance. It mentions developing a predictive model using data from student records, teacher evaluations, and environmental factors. The methodology combines qualitative and quantitative approaches. The findings highlight the model's accuracy and the importance of incorporating various variables. The implications stress the need for data-driven decision-making and a holistic approach to educational data analysis.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topic that comes to mind is Machine Learning (T1). The abstract talks about predictive models, which are a key aspect of machine learning. The mention of integrating various data sources and using a model to forecast outcomes strongly aligns with machine learning techniques. The subtopics under T1 include Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc., but the abstract doesn't specify which one, so I can't assign a subtopic here.\n\nI should also consider if any other topics from the codebook are present. Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. Behavioral Economics (T8) isn't mentioned either. Digital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) aren't discussed in the abstract. So, the only relevant topic is Machine Learning (T1).\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract related to Machine Learning. The entire abstract revolves around developing and applying a predictive model, which is a machine learning application. Therefore, I'd say 100% of the abstract is related to T1. My confidence is high because the focus is clearly on machine learning techniques.\n\nFor subtopics, since the abstract doesn't specify any particular subtopic under Machine Learning, I can't confidently assign any. Therefore, there are no subtopics identified.\n\nIn summary, the abstract is entirely about Machine Learning, with no subtopics explicitly mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the application of artificial intelligence techniques, specifically predictive modeling, which falls under the broader topic of Machine Learning (T1).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses urbanization and the need for resilient cities. It focuses on the relationships between urban environments, online interactions, and human wellbeing. It mentions privacy-preserving technologies, social media platforms, and the impact of data privacy on trust and safety, especially in marginalized communities. It also talks about misinformation, healthy behaviors, and the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving privacy-enhancing technologies.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7) because the abstract is about creating thriving cities, which is a key aspect of sustainable development. The subtopics under T7 include Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities. The abstract's focus on urban resilience and fostering healthy communities aligns with Sustainable Cities.\n\nNext, the abstract discusses privacy-preserving technologies and data privacy. This falls under Digital Security (T9), specifically the subtopic Privacy Enhancing Technologies. The mention of end-to-end encryption and mitigating data exploitation directly relates to this subtopic.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on urban development and digital security aspects.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The abstract spends about 60% discussing Sustainable Development, particularly how cities can be made resilient and sustainable. The remaining 40% is about Digital Security, especially privacy technologies.\n\nFor confidence, I'm very confident about T7 and T9, so I'll rate them 5 each. The subtopics Privacy Enhancing Technologies and Sustainable Cities are clearly mentioned, so their confidence is also high at 5 each.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other topics. The abstract doesn't discuss methodologies like supervised learning or behavioral economics theories, so those aren't applicable here.\n\nIn summary, the topics are T7 and T9, with their respective subtopics. The disambiguation explanation should clarify that Sustainable Development is the broader field, while Digital Security is about the technologies used to support it.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the development of resilient cities (Sustainable Development - T7) and the role of privacy-preserving technologies (Digital Security - T9).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of social media data in urban planning and the associated privacy concerns. It mentions data-driven urban planning, individual privacy, and the challenges related to transparency, bias, and balancing privacy with data use. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, including interviews with urban planners, policymakers, and social media users. The proposed framework emphasizes transparency, accountability, and participatory governance.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for the topics:\n\n1. **Public Health (T10)**: The abstract doesn't directly discuss public health issues, epidemiology, or health systems. It's more about urban planning and privacy, so I don't think T10 applies here.\n\n2. **Digital Security (T9)**: This topic includes aspects like cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection. The abstract talks about privacy concerns, misuse of personal data, and challenges in data collection transparency. These elements fall under Digital Security. The discussion of privacy risks and the need for accountability aligns with T9.\n\n3. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: While urban planning is mentioned, the focus is on the data and privacy aspects rather than sustainable development goals like renewable energy or resource management. So, T7 might not be the primary focus here.\n\n4. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any specific machine learning techniques or models. It's more about the use of data in planning, not the algorithms themselves. So, T1 isn't directly relevant.\n\n5. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The study doesn't delve into decision-making processes, cognitive biases, or economic behaviors. It's more about the ethical and privacy implications of data use, so T8 doesn't fit.\n\nSo, the main topic is **Digital Security (T9)**. The abstract is entirely focused on privacy issues in data-driven urban planning, which is a subset of digital security. Therefore, T9 has a 100% proportion.\n\nNext, for subtopics under T9:\n\n- **Privacy Enhancing Technologies**: The abstract doesn't mention specific technologies but discusses privacy concerns and the need for transparency and accountability. This relates more to the broader aspects of privacy rather than specific technologies.\n\n- **Cybersecurity**: The focus isn't on protecting systems from cyber threats but on the ethical use of data, so this doesn't fit.\n\n- **Authentication Methods**: Not relevant here.\n\n- **Threat Detection**: Again, not applicable as the focus is on privacy rather than detecting threats.\n\n- **Security Policy**: The abstract does touch on policy implications, suggesting the need for frameworks that protect privacy. This is somewhat related but not a primary focus.\n\nGiven this, none of the subtopics under T9 are explicitly mentioned. The abstract discusses privacy concerns but doesn't delve into specific subtopics like privacy technologies or cybersecurity measures. Therefore, no subtopics are identified.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily addresses Digital Security (T9) with a focus on privacy issues in urban planning, but it doesn't specify any particular subtopics from the codebook.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses privacy concerns and data usage in urban planning, which falls under Digital Security (T9).

The system's ability to learn from data and adjust patterns also relates to Transfer Learning. So, both Supervised Learning and Transfer Learning are relevant subtopics.\n\nUnder T7, the study focuses on energy efficiency and resource management, which are subtopics of Sustainable Development. The application in sports infrastructure and the broader implications for sustainable energy systems support this.\n\nI'll estimate the proportions: about 60% of the abstract discusses Machine Learning methods and their application, while 40% focuses on the Sustainable Development aspects, particularly energy efficiency and resource management.\n\nConfidence levels are high for both topics since the abstract clearly outlines the use of machine learning techniques and sustainable development goals. The subtopics are also well-supported by the content.\n\nSo, the final analysis includes T1 and T7 as topics, with their respective subtopics. Other topics from the codebook aren't present in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of computational intelligence and predictive modeling, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses an interdisciplinary study that combines AI, energy efficiency, and sports training. It mentions using deep neural networks, transfer learning, and reinforcement learning. The framework developed aims to predict and optimize energy consumption in sports facilities, leading to cost savings and environmental benefits.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll identify the topics. The abstract heavily focuses on AI techniques like neural networks and reinforcement learning, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). The study's application in energy efficiency and sustainability points to Sustainable Development (T7). There's no mention of Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, or Public Health, so those can be excluded.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion each topic takes. The abstract spends about 60% discussing AI methods and their application, which is under T1. The remaining 40% is about energy efficiency and sustainability, which is T7.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions transfer learning and reinforcement learning, both of which are subtopics under Machine Learning (T1). Transfer learning is used for adapting models to new data, and reinforcement learning is part of the optimization module. These are clearly subtopics from the codebook.\n\nI'm confident about T1 and T7 because the abstract explicitly discusses AI and sustainability. The subtopics are directly mentioned, so my confidence is high there too.\n\nI need to structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring that the topics and subtopics are correctly identified with their proportions and confidence levels. I'll make sure the JSON is valid and doesn't include any extra text or markdown.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of deep neural networks and transfer learning, which are subtopics under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of technology in early childhood education, highlighting both benefits and vulnerabilities. It mentions the development of safeguarding protocols using advanced technology. The study involves computational methods, human-centered design, and testing in a lab setting. The results show improved threat detection and response, with specific accuracy rates and reductions in false positives. The implications are for policymakers, educators, and tech developers.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The main areas discussed are technology in education, safeguarding protocols, computational methods, and human-centered design. \n\nFirst, I consider \"Machine Learning\" (T1). The abstract talks about computational methods and detecting behavioral patterns, which could involve machine learning techniques like supervised or unsupervised learning. However, the term \"machine learning\" isn't explicitly mentioned, so it's a bit of a stretch.\n\nNext, \"Sustainable Development\" (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. The focus is on education and safety, not environmental or resource management issues.\n\n\"Behavioral Economics\" (T8) is about decision-making and cognitive biases. While the study involves human behavior, it's more about detecting threats rather than studying economic decisions influenced by behavior.\n\n\"Digital Security\" (T9) is a strong candidate. The abstract discusses safeguarding protocols, vulnerabilities, threat detection, and real-time monitoring, all of which fall under digital security. This seems to be the primary topic.\n\n\"Public Health\" (T10) is about health at the population level. While the study aims to protect children, it's more about security in an educational context rather than public health issues like disease prevention or health equity.\n\nSo, the main topic is T9 (Digital Security). It's mentioned in the context of developing protocols, threat detection, and monitoring. The proportion of the abstract related to T9 is significant, probably around 70%. The confidence is high because the content directly relates to security measures.\n\nFor subtopics under T9, the abstract mentions threat detection and monitoring, which aligns with \"Threat Detection.\" This is a clear subtopic. The confidence here is also high because the study specifically talks about detecting and responding to threats.\n\nI don't see evidence for other subtopics like cybersecurity, privacy enhancing technologies, authentication methods, or security policy. The focus is more on the detection aspect rather than, say, encryption or access control.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily deals with Digital Security (T9) and its subtopic Threat Detection. Other topics and subtopics aren't as relevant or explicitly mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the development of safeguarding protocols using advanced technology to mitigate risks in early childhood education.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of risk management strategies and intelligent systems in childcare environments. It mentions developing a framework using digital security and machine learning. The methodology includes data collection, analysis, and simulation, using mixed methods. The results highlight real-time anomaly detection, continuous learning, and actionable insights. The implications suggest applications beyond childcare, like education and healthcare.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions machine learning and supervised learning, which is a subtopic under T1. The framework uses learning processes, so this is a strong indicator. \n\nNext, Digital Security (T9) is mentioned as part of the framework, and the subtopic Threat Detection is relevant since the system detects anomalies. \n\nSustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem to fit here as there's no mention of environmental or resource management aspects. Behavioral Economics (T8) isn't present either, as the study doesn't discuss decision-making biases or economic behaviors. Public Health (T10) isn't directly addressed; the focus is on risk management rather than health outcomes or epidemiology.\n\nSo, the main topics are T1 and T9. The abstract spends about 60% on Machine Learning, detailing its application and methods, and 40% on Digital Security, focusing on threat detection and system adaptation. \n\nFor subtopics, Supervised Learning (T1) is clearly mentioned, and Threat Detection (T9) is evident from the anomaly detection. \n\nI'm confident about these identifications, so the confidence ratings are high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of machine learning (T1) in the context of risk management and intelligent systems, specifically mentioning supervised learning as a subtopic.

The user wants me to code this using their predefined codebook. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The abstract talks about sustainable development, specifically in the context of exercise facilities. They mention green technologies, energy efficiency, and renewable energy sources like solar panels and wind turbines. That clearly points to Sustainable Development (T7). \n\nNext, there's a significant part about cyber resilience, discussing encryption protocols and secure networks. This falls under Digital Security (T9). \n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends about 60% discussing eco-friendly infrastructure and energy efficiency, which is under T7. The remaining 40% is about cyber threats and security measures, so that's T9.\n\nFor subtopics, under T7, the focus is on Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring. They talk about energy-harvesting systems and monitoring emissions, so those are the subtopics. Under T9, the subtopics are Cybersecurity and Threat Detection, as they mention encryption and mitigating cyber attacks.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly mentions the relevant terms. The disambiguation is clear since Sustainable Development deals with environmental aspects, while Digital Security handles the cyber elements. They don't overlap here, making it straightforward.\n\nI think that's all.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of renewable energy sources and adaptive threat mitigation strategies to enhance energetic resilience, particularly in the context of exercise routines and overall well-being. It mentions the use of smart grid technologies and advanced threat detection systems. The study's implications are tied to creating more sustainable and secure environments, contributing to resilient communities.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the abstract's content to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each topic:\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or related methodologies. It focuses more on energy systems and threat mitigation, not on data-driven models or predictive analytics. So, T1 is likely not present.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract heavily discusses renewable energy, resource management (through smart grids), and environmental impact reduction. These are all subtopics under Sustainable Development. The study's focus on creating sustainable and secure environments aligns with T7.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: There's no mention of decision-making processes, cognitive biases, or economic behaviors in the abstract. The focus is on technological and environmental aspects, not on human behavior or economic choices. So, T8 isn't applicable.\n\n4. **Digital Security (T9)**: The abstract talks about adaptive threat mitigation, threat detection systems, and security protocols. These elements fall under Digital Security, specifically focusing on cybersecurity and threat detection, which are subtopics of T9.\n\n5. **Public Health (T10)**: While the abstract mentions exercise routines and well-being, it doesn't delve into public health frameworks, epidemiology, or health systems. The focus is more on the environmental and security aspects of exercise, not public health policies or interventions. Thus, T10 isn't directly addressed.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each identified topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing renewable energy and resource management, which are core to Sustainable Development (T7). Threat mitigation and security aspects are also discussed, but they are secondary to the overall focus on sustainability. Therefore, I'll allocate approximately 70% to T7 and 30% to T9.\n\nFor subtopics, under Sustainable Development (T7), Renewable Energy and Resource Management are clearly mentioned. Under Digital Security (T9), Adaptive Threat Mitigation and Threat Detection are discussed. Each subtopic is directly referenced in the abstract, so I'm confident in their identification.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily addresses Sustainable Development and Digital Security, with specific subtopics highlighted. Other topics from the codebook aren't relevant here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Adaptive Threat Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses renewable energy and resource management, which fall under Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of advanced data analytics in education, specifically focusing on risk management. It mentions the development of sophisticated models, hybrid approaches combining domain-adaptive models with principles of prospect theory, and the impact on decision-making under uncertainty. It also talks about laboratory experiments, predictive accuracy, and real-world applications in educational settings.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract heavily uses terms like \"data analytics,\" \"models,\" \"supervised learning,\" and \"machine learning.\" These are all related to Machine Learning (T1). The discussion of models, their development, and their application in experiments clearly falls under this topic. The proportion of the abstract dealing with Machine Learning seems significant, probably around 60%.\n\nNext, the abstract references cognitive psychology, prospect theory, cognitive biases, and heuristics. These terms are directly tied to Behavioral Economics (T8). The integration of these psychological principles into the risk management model indicates that Behavioral Economics is another key topic. This might account for about 40% of the abstract.\n\nNow, looking at subtopics, the abstract mentions \"supervised learning,\" which is a subtopic under Machine Learning (T1). Additionally, it discusses \"cognitive biases,\" which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). These subtopics are explicitly mentioned and are central to the study's methodology.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on data analytics and decision-making, not environmental or health-related issues.\n\nTo summarize, the two main topics are Machine Learning (T1) and Behavioral Economics (T8), with subtopics being \"Supervised Learning\" and \"Cognitive Biases.\" The confidence levels are high for both topics and subtopics since the abstract clearly discusses these areas.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of machine learning techniques (e.g., domain-adaptive models, supervised learning) and their integration with principles from cognitive psychology (e.g., prospect theory, cognitive biases).

Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about integrating adaptive models with human decision-making in educational settings. It mentions using a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data. They used a laboratory science framework to develop and test these models. The results show improvements in decision-making outcomes, like reduced errors in risk assessment and increased informed strategies. The implications are for educational policy, teacher training, and student support.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics match. The main areas discussed are adaptive models, decision-making, and educational applications. \n\nFirst, the topic \"Machine Learning\" (T1) seems relevant because adaptive models are a type of machine learning. The abstract uses terms like \"adaptive models\" and \"predicting human decision-making,\" which align with machine learning methodologies. The proportion here is about 40% since a significant part discusses the models and their application.\n\nNext, \"Behavioral Economics\" (T8) is another fit because the study focuses on human decision-making, which is a core aspect of behavioral economics. They mention decision-making in educational contexts, risk assessment, and informed strategies. This takes up about 35% of the abstract.\n\nThe remaining 25% touches on \"Public Health\" (T10), particularly in the implications for educational policy and support services, which fall under public health's focus on population health and equity.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning, \"Supervised Learning\" isn't explicitly mentioned, but adaptive models could fall under this. However, it's a bit of a stretch. Under Behavioral Economics, \"Decision Making\" and \"Risk Assessment\" are clearly discussed, so those are solid subtopics. \n\nI'm confident about T8 and its subtopics, but T1 and T10 are a bit less direct. The abstract doesn't explicitly mention public health, but the applications in education could relate. \n\nSo, I'll code T1 at 40% with medium confidence, T8 at 35% with high confidence, and T10 at 25% with medium confidence. The subtopics are \"Decision Making\" and \"Risk Assessment\" from T8, each with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses adaptive models (T1) and their application in understanding human decision-making (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a qualitative study focused on creative problem-solving in the educational sector. It mentions several areas: identity verification, eco-friendly energy, proactive wellness strategies, authentication systems, renewable energy infrastructure, health education, and infectious disease prevention. It also talks about interdisciplinary collaboration and sustainable development.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for mentions of Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't explicitly mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or related methodologies. So, I don't think T1 is present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) seems relevant. The abstract discusses eco-friendly energy, renewable energy infrastructure, and sustainable practices, which are all part of Sustainable Development. The proportion of the abstract related to this is significant, maybe around 40%.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is another possible topic. The abstract talks about identity verification, authentication systems, and security concerns, which fall under Digital Security. This might take up about 30% of the abstract.\n\nPublic Health (T10) is also present. The study mentions health education, disease prevention, and wellness strategies, which are key areas in Public Health. This could account for around 30% of the content.\n\nNow, looking at subtopics. For Sustainable Development (T7), the subtopics mentioned are Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring. The abstract discusses eco-friendly energy and renewable infrastructure, so Renewable Energy (T7.1) is definitely present. There's also a mention of environmental stewardship, which could relate to Environmental Monitoring, but it's not explicitly detailed, so I'm less confident about that.\n\nUnder Digital Security (T9), the subtopics include Cybersecurity and Authentication Methods. The abstract specifically talks about authentication systems, so Authentication Methods (T9.3) is clearly present. There's no mention of other subtopics like Threat Detection or Privacy Enhancing Technologies, so only this one applies.\n\nFor Public Health (T10), the subtopics are Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. The study discusses health education and disease prevention strategies, so Disease Prevention (T10.3) is relevant. There's also a focus on wellness, which could relate to Health Promotion (T10.2), but the emphasis is more on prevention, so I'm more confident about Disease Prevention.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. For example, while the abstract mentions technology and environment, these are part of broader topics like Digital Security and Sustainable Development. The study's focus on problem-solving and integration across domains suggests an interdisciplinary approach, but each specific area still falls under its respective topic.\n\nI should also consider the confidence levels. Sustainable Development and Digital Security are clearly discussed, so I'll rate them at confidence 4. Public Health is mentioned but not as extensively, so confidence 3.\n\nFor subtopics, Renewable Energy and Authentication Methods are directly mentioned, so confidence 4 each. Disease Prevention is also clearly discussed, so confidence 4.\n\nI think that's all. I don't see any other topics or subtopics from the codebook that fit the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses eco-friendly energy and renewable infrastructure, aligning with Sustainable Development's Renewable Energy subtopic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about integrating secure authentication protocols and renewable energy sources in educational institutions. It mentions sustainability, reducing carbon footprints, and enhancing security. They used a qualitative approach with interviews, and the findings discuss energy consumption, cost savings, security posture, and impacts on learning outcomes.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the main topics. The abstract discusses renewable energy and secure authentication. Renewable energy falls under Sustainable Development (T7), and secure authentication is part of Digital Security (T9). I don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10). So, the topics are T7 and T9.\n\nNext, estimating the proportion. The abstract spends about half discussing renewable energy and sustainability, and the other half on secure authentication and security. So, each would be around 50%. \n\nConfidence for T7 is high because renewable energy is a key focus. Similarly, T9 is confidently identified as secure authentication is central. Both get a 5.\n\nFor subtopics, under T7, Renewable Energy is explicitly mentioned, so that's a subtopic. Under T9, Secure Authentication is a subtopic. Both are clearly discussed, so confidence is 5 for each.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention other areas like cybersecurity or environmental monitoring, so only these two subtopics apply.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should reflect T7 and T9 each at 50%, with their respective subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 50,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 50,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Secure Authentication\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of renewable energy sources and secure authentication protocols, clearly aligning with the Sustainable Development (T7) and Digital Security (T9) topics.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of wearable devices and online platforms in the exercise landscape, focusing on data security and governance frameworks. It mentions the analysis of governance frameworks, predictive modeling, and policy harmonization. The study uses a quasi-experimental design, examining 15 platforms and 500 user accounts. It highlights issues with data protection and the role of predictive modeling in identifying security breaches.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the topic of Digital Security (T9) seems relevant because the abstract talks about safeguarding fitness information, data protection protocols, and security breaches. The discussion of governance frameworks and policy harmonization also falls under Digital Security, specifically under the subtopic of Security Policy.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions predictive modeling, which is a method used in Machine Learning (T1). Predictive modeling is a subtopic under Machine Learning, specifically Supervised Learning, as it involves using historical data to make predictions.\n\nI don't see evidence of Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on data security and predictive modeling, not on environmental issues, economic behavior, or public health initiatives.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing data security, governance frameworks, and policy harmonization, which are under Digital Security. Predictive modeling is mentioned in the context of identifying vulnerabilities, which is a smaller part but still substantial. I'll estimate that about 70% of the abstract is about Digital Security and 30% about Machine Learning.\n\nFor confidence, I'm quite sure about Digital Security (T9) with a confidence of 5. For Machine Learning (T1), while predictive modeling is clearly mentioned, the context is more about its application in security, so I'll rate it a 4.\n\nRegarding subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions predictive modeling, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning. Additionally, the discussion of governance frameworks and policy harmonization points to Security Policy under Digital Security. So, the subtopics identified are Predictive Modeling and Security Policy, each with a confidence of 4 and 5 respectively.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics and subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while the subtopics are the specific areas within those fields discussed in the abstract.\n\nSo, to summarize, the abstract primarily discusses Digital Security with a focus on Security Policy and also touches on Machine Learning through Predictive Modeling.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.7,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.3,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Predictive Modeling\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Security Policy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses data security and governance frameworks, which fall under Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of predictive analytics in exercise science, specifically using machine learning algorithms to predict individualized workout plans. It mentions a study where machine learning models were used to create personalized fitness programs, and the results showed significant improvements in participants' physical fitness metrics. The study also highlights the importance of contextual factors like motivation and adherence.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract explicitly mentions machine learning algorithms, their application in predicting workout plans, and the model's accuracy. This clearly falls under T1. The discussion of predictive analytics and the model's performance also relates to machine learning. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, I'll consider Public Health (T10). The study is about optimizing fitness programs, which relates to health outcomes. The abstract mentions implications for exercise science, which can be linked to public health as it deals with population-level health improvements. However, the focus is more on the application of machine learning rather than public health policies or systems. So, T10 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\nNow, checking the other topics: Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. There's no mention of renewable energy, climate change, or resource management. Behavioral Economics (T8) isn't directly addressed either; while the study touches on participant motivation, it's not framed within the context of behavioral economics theories or decision-making processes. Digital Security (T9) is unrelated as there's no discussion of cybersecurity or privacy issues.\n\nFor subtopics under T1, the abstract uses machine learning algorithms, which is a subtopic. It doesn't specify the type of machine learning (like supervised or unsupervised), so only \"Machine Learning Algorithms\" is applicable.\n\nIn terms of proportions, the majority of the abstract discusses machine learning applications, so T1 would take up about 70%. The remaining 30% touches on public health implications, so T10 gets 30%.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about T1 (confidence 5) and somewhat confident about T10 (confidence 4). For subtopics, I'm confident about \"Machine Learning Algorithms\" (confidence 4) since it's explicitly mentioned.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main focus is on machine learning (topic) with the specific application of algorithms (subtopic). Public health is a secondary topic, but it's not the primary focus.\n\nSo, the final analysis should list T1 and T10 as topics with their respective proportions and confidences, and the subtopic under T1 as \"Machine Learning Algorithms\" with a confidence rating.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Machine Learning Algorithms\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms in exercise science, which falls under the broader topic of Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how individuals share personal information online without fully understanding the consequences. It talks about online identity management and the balance between privacy and self-expression. The study uses theoretical frameworks from human decision-making, focusing on cognitive biases and heuristics influencing online behavior. It identifies three key factors: illusion of control, affect heuristic, and availability cascade. The implications suggest a need for a human-centered approach in system design and more effective online policies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract mentions human decision-making, cognitive biases, and heuristics. These terms are directly related to Behavioral Economics (T8). The subtopics under T8 include Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, and Risk Assessment. The abstract specifically discusses cognitive biases and heuristics, which are subtopics under T8. So, T8 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the study's implications discuss online policies and regulations, which ties into Public Health (T10). The subtopics under T10 include Health Systems and Policy Analysis. The abstract mentions the need for effective online policies, which falls under the Health Systems subtopic. Therefore, T10 is another topic present.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), or Digital Security (T9). The focus is on human behavior and policy, not technology or security mechanisms.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends a significant portion discussing cognitive biases and decision-making, which is about 60% of the content. The remaining 40% is about policy implications, so T10 gets 40%.\n\nConfidence for T8 is high (5/5) because the abstract clearly discusses cognitive biases and decision-making frameworks. For T10, confidence is also high (5/5) as the policy implications are explicitly mentioned.\n\nRegarding subtopics, the abstract clearly mentions Cognitive Biases and Decision Making. The mention of affect heuristic and availability cascade also relates to Risk Assessment, but it's a bit more indirect. So, I'll include Cognitive Biases and Decision Making with high confidence, and Risk Assessment with moderate confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping with subtopics. The affect heuristic and availability cascade are specific examples of cognitive biases, so they fall under Cognitive Biases. Therefore, the subtopics are Cognitive Biases and Decision Making.\n\nI think that's all. No other subtopics from other topics are mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cognitive biases and decision-making frameworks, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online platforms affect decision-making, focusing on risk perception and human judgment in digital governance. It mentions behavioral economics principles, risk perception, and proposes a governance approach. It also talks about designing online systems and policy recommendations.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFrom the abstract, the primary focus is on how people perceive risks online and how this influences their decisions. The study uses principles from behavioral economics, which directly points to T8. There's no mention of machine learning techniques, so T1 isn't relevant. The abstract doesn't discuss sustainability or environmental issues, so T7 is out. While there's a mention of digital governance and online security, the focus is more on the human behavior aspect rather than security technologies, so T9 isn't the main topic. Public health isn't addressed either, so T10 isn't applicable.\n\nNow, for subtopics under T8, the abstract discusses risk perception and how it influences decision-making. It talks about risk aversion and risk-taking behavior, which falls under \"Risk Assessment\" and \"Decision Making.\" There's also a mention of cognitive biases, like overestimating risks, which relates to \"Cognitive Biases.\" \n\nSo, the main topic is T8 with a high confidence level. The subtopics are Risk Assessment, Decision Making, and Cognitive Biases, each with high confidence as they are clearly discussed in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of behavioral economics principles to understand risk perception and decision-making in online environments.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about a qualitative study looking into human psychology, online interactions, and environmental concerns. It specifically mentions online advertising and how it influences environmentally friendly behaviors. They used a mixed-methods approach with interviews and surveys. The findings show that visual cues and trustworthiness of sources affect eco-friendly choices, and social norms also play a role.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present.\n\nFirst, the main topics. The study is about human behavior, decision-making, and how psychological factors influence actions related to the environment. That sounds like Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract doesn't mention any Machine Learning (T1) techniques, so I can rule that out. Sustainable Development (T7) is mentioned in the context of environmental concerns, but the focus is more on the behavioral aspects rather than the sustainable practices themselves. Public Health (T10) isn't really addressed here, and Digital Security (T9) isn't relevant either.\n\nSo, the primary topic is Behavioral Economics (T8). It seems to cover about 80% of the abstract since most of the discussion revolves around decision-making, influences on behavior, and the role of social norms. The remaining 20% touches on environmental concerns, which is part of Sustainable Development (T7), but it's more of a context rather than the main focus.\n\nNext, for subtopics under Behavioral Economics, the abstract discusses decision-making (participants making eco-friendly choices), cognitive biases (subtle cues influencing decisions), and social preferences (the impact of social norms and trust in sources). Each of these subtopics is clearly present in the findings.\n\nI'm confident about identifying Behavioral Economics as the main topic with a high confidence level. The subtopics are directly mentioned in the context of the study's findings, so my confidence in those is also high.\n\nI don't think any other topics from the codebook are relevant here. The focus is clearly on the behavioral aspects influencing environmental decisions, fitting under Behavioral Economics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Preferences\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses human decision-making influenced by psychological factors and social norms within the context of environmental concerns, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online advertisements influence consumer behavior, particularly in promoting sustainable consumption. It mentions the use of nudges, subtle cues, and incentives. The study involves behavioral sciences, marketing professionals, and consumers. The methodology includes in-depth interviews and content analysis of advertisements. The findings highlight the effectiveness of social norms, environmental framing, rewards, and incentives, but also note the impact of cognitive biases and social media influence.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8) because the study focuses on how psychological factors influence consumer decisions, which is a core aspect of Behavioral Economics. The abstract mentions nudges, cognitive biases, and decision-making, all of which are subtopics under T8. The proportion of the abstract related to Behavioral Economics is quite high, maybe around 60%, as most of the discussion revolves around these concepts.\n\nNext, the study also touches on Public Health (T10), particularly in the context of promoting sustainable consumption and mitigating climate change. This is a more secondary focus, so I'd estimate about 30% of the abstract relates to this topic. The subtopics here might include Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, but since the focus is more on environmental sustainability, it's a bit tangential.\n\nThere's also a mention of methodologies like content analysis and interviews, which could relate to Research Methods, but since that's not in the codebook, I'll focus on the provided topics.\n\nFor subtopics under Behavioral Economics, the abstract clearly discusses Decision Making and Cognitive Biases. These are directly mentioned and are central to the study's findings. The confidence for these subtopics is high.\n\nIn summary, the primary topic is Behavioral Economics with a significant portion of the abstract, followed by Public Health as a supporting topic. The subtopics are well-aligned with the study's focus on decision-making processes influenced by behavioral factors.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the impact of nudges and cognitive biases on consumer behavior, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses three main areas: predictive analytics, data protection, and athletic well-being. It mentions using advanced statistical models like gradient boosting and random forests, which are part of machine learning techniques. So, Machine Learning (T1) is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the abstract talks about data breaches, encryption protocols, and security audits. These are all related to Digital Security (T9). The study shows how implementing robust security measures reduces the risk of data compromise, which falls under Digital Security.\n\nThe third area is about athlete performance and well-being, which seems to touch on Public Health (T10). The study highlights how integrating predictive analytics and data protection can reduce injuries and improve team performance, which relates to health outcomes and systems.\n\nNow, looking at the subtopics. Under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract specifically mentions \"ensemble methods, specifically gradient boosting and random forests.\" These are techniques within Supervised Learning, so that's a subtopic.\n\nFor Digital Security (T9), the subtopics mentioned are encryption protocols, access control, and security audits. These fall under Cybersecurity, which is a subtopic of Digital Security.\n\nIn terms of proportions, the abstract spends about 40% on Machine Learning, 35% on Digital Security, and 25% on Public Health. Each topic is clearly addressed with specific details, so my confidence in these identifications is high, around 4-5.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention anything about Behavioral Economics or Sustainable Development, so those aren't relevant here. \n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the relevant subtopics with their confidence. I'll also include a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics based on the content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of predictive analytics (Machine Learning) and data protection (Digital Security) in the context of athlete performance and well-being (Public Health).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a mixed-methods study that applies advanced predictive analytics to identify at-risk athletes during professional team sports matches. It mentions using traditional statistical models combined with machine-based ensemble learning approaches. The study's goal is to develop a predictive framework for injury risk assessment, which includes integrating multiple data sources like player tracking data, match statistics, and weather data. The findings suggest that this approach can reduce injury-related absenteeism and contribute to the literature on predictive analytics in sports. It also highlights interdisciplinary collaboration between sports medicine, data analysts, and computer scientists.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are predictive analytics, which falls under Machine Learning (T1), and the application in sports, which relates to Public Health (T10) as it deals with injury prevention and health outcomes.\n\nFor Machine Learning (T1), the abstract extensively discusses the use of ensemble learning, statistical models, and predictive frameworks. This seems to be the primary focus, so I'll allocate a higher proportion, maybe 70%. My confidence here is high, so a 5.\n\nFor Public Health (T10), the study's application in injury prevention and its impact on athlete health and performance are significant. This contributes about 30% of the abstract, and I'm fairly confident, so a 4.\n\nNext, identifying subtopics. The abstract mentions \"machine-based ensemble learning approaches,\" which is a subtopic under Machine Learning. Specifically, ensemble learning isn't explicitly listed, but it's a form of supervised learning. Therefore, Supervised Learning (T1) is a relevant subtopic with high confidence (4).\n\nAdditionally, the study's application in injury prevention and health outcomes relates to Disease Prevention under Public Health (T10). This is a key subtopic, so I'll note that with a confidence of 4.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention behavioral economics or digital security, so those aren't applicable. Sustainable development isn't directly addressed either.\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Machine Learning and Public Health, with subtopics in Supervised Learning and Disease Prevention. The proportions and confidence levels reflect the focus on predictive analytics and its health implications.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of predictive analytics, which falls under Machine Learning (T1), with a focus on supervised learning techniques.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses the balance between data protection and accessibility in educational institutions. It mentions information protection frameworks, policy development, and the need for a multi-stakeholder approach. It also talks about moving beyond compliance to a risk-based strategy. The implications include better policies, secure systems, and informed communities.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to see which topics align with this content. The main areas discussed are information protection, policy development, and risk management. \n\nFirst, I consider \"Digital Security\" (T9). The abstract talks about confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, which are key aspects of digital security. It also mentions policy development and implementation, which fall under the subtopics of Digital Security, specifically \"Security Policy.\" The discussion of a risk-based strategy ties into \"Threat Detection\" and overall security practices. So, T9 seems to be the primary topic here.\n\nNext, I think about \"Sustainable Development\" (T7). While the abstract doesn't explicitly mention sustainability, environmental issues, or renewable energy, the focus on balancing data protection with accessibility could be seen as promoting sustainable practices in information management. However, this connection is more tenuous and not directly supported by the text. Therefore, T7 might be a secondary topic with lower confidence.\n\nI don't see any direct mention of Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Public Health in the abstract. The focus is on security and policy, not on learning algorithms, behavioral decision-making, or public health initiatives.\n\nFor subtopics under T9, the abstract discusses policy development and implementation, which directly relates to \"Security Policy.\" Additionally, the risk-based strategy touches on \"Threat Detection.\" These subtopics are clearly present and discussed in detail.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily deals with Digital Security, with some tangential relevance to Sustainable Development. The subtopics of Security Policy and Threat Detection are well-supported by the content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Security Policy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses information protection and policy development in educational settings, aligning with Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the increasing reliance on digital technologies in educational institutions and the need for robust cybersecurity measures. It mentions challenges in implementing effective security policies and presents a framework addressing this issue. Key factors include clear guidelines, training programs, and threat detection tools. The study emphasizes the impact on student learning outcomes and advocates for a proactive approach to cybersecurity.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Digital Security (T9). The abstract repeatedly mentions cybersecurity, security policies, threat detection tools, and the importance of proactive measures. These are all directly related to Digital Security. The proportion of the abstract focused on this topic is significant, covering the problem statement, methodology, findings, and recommendations. I estimate about 80% of the abstract is dedicated to Digital Security, with high confidence (5/5).\n\nNext, the abstract touches on the impact of cybersecurity on student learning outcomes and the environment. This relates to Public Health (T10), specifically how a safe environment contributes to academic performance and engagement. While this is a secondary focus, it's still a notable part of the discussion. I would allocate approximately 20% of the abstract to this topic, with moderate confidence (3/5) since it's not the primary focus but still relevant.\n\nFor subtopics, under Digital Security (T9), the abstract mentions several key factors. \"Security Policy\" is explicitly discussed as a critical factor, so that's a clear subtopic. \"Threat Detection\" is also mentioned with examples like intrusion detection systems and antivirus software. These are both subtopics under T9. I'm confident about these identifications, so I'll rate them 5/5 each.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily addresses Digital Security with a significant portion discussing its subtopics, and secondarily touches on Public Health regarding the educational environment's impact.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Security Policy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses cybersecurity measures in educational settings, which falls under the Digital Security (T9) topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the convergence of environmental stewardship and athletic excellence in professional sports. It mentions eco-friendly practices, data analytics, strategic decision-making, anomaly detection, adaptive policy implementation, and machine-driven insights. The study uses mixed-methods, including case studies and data modeling, to identify KPIs influenced by environmental factors. They developed a hybrid framework combining domain knowledge with statistical analysis and machine intelligence. The findings include reductions in energy consumption and emissions, and improved team performance using intelligent systems and reinforcement mechanisms.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract talks about data analytics, machine learning techniques like anomaly detection, and machine-driven insights. This points to the Machine Learning topic (T1). The subtopics under T1 include Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. The abstract mentions \"intelligent anomaly recognition systems\" which relates to anomaly detection, a subtopic under Machine Learning. Additionally, the use of reinforcement mechanisms suggests Reinforcement Learning.\n\nNext, the study focuses on environmental practices and sustainable development in sports. This aligns with Sustainable Development (T7). The subtopics under T7 include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, etc. The abstract discusses reducing ecological footprints, which relates to Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities, though the latter isn't explicitly mentioned. However, the focus is more on monitoring and mitigation, so Environmental Monitoring is a relevant subtopic.\n\nI don't see evidence of Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on environmental practices and data analytics, so those are the only two topics present.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends about 60% discussing Machine Learning (methods, models, findings) and 40% on Sustainable Development (practices, impacts, policies). \n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about Machine Learning (T1) with a 5/5. Sustainable Development (T7) is also clear, but since it's a bit more about application than theory, I'll rate it 4/5.\n\nFor subtopics, Anomaly Detection is clearly mentioned, so confidence is 5/5. Environmental Monitoring is a good fit, but it's a bit inferred, so 4/5. Reinforcement Learning is mentioned through mechanisms, so 4/5 confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention other subtopics like Renewable Energy or Resource Management, so those aren't applicable here.\n\nSo, the final JSON should include T1 and T7 as topics with their proportions and confidence, and the subtopics Anomaly Detection, Environmental Monitoring, and Reinforcement Learning with their confidence levels.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Anomaly Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of advanced data analytics and machine-driven intelligence, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses the impact of climate-induced disruptions on global sports events. It mentions a multidisciplinary approach to develop an adaptive feedback system using principles like climate-resilient planning, threat awareness, and reinforcement-based optimization. The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analyses. The results show improvements in athlete performance and injury reduction, and the study emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the abstract's content to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, I'll identify the main topics. The abstract talks about climate-induced disruptions, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). It also discusses the use of reinforcement-based optimization, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). The mixed-methods approach and the focus on athlete performance and injury prevention touch on Public Health (T10). However, the primary focus seems to be on the technical system development, so T7 and T1 are more prominent.\n\nNext, for subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions reinforcement-based optimization, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning (T1). It also discusses climate-resilient planning, which is a subtopic under Sustainable Development (T7). The mixed-methods approach relates to Public Health (T10), but since it's a method rather than a subtopic, it might not be as directly relevant.\n\nI'll estimate the proportions: Sustainable Development (T7) seems to cover about 40% of the abstract, focusing on climate aspects. Machine Learning (T1) is about 35%, as it's central to the system's optimization. Public Health (T10) is around 25%, dealing with injury prevention and performance, though less emphasized.\n\nFor subtopics, reinforcement-based optimization is clearly a key element, so it's a high-confidence match. Climate-resilient planning is also explicitly mentioned, making it another subtopic. The mixed-methods approach is more of a methodology than a subtopic, so I might not include it unless it's a subtopic under another category, which it isn't in the codebook.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main topics are the broader areas, while subtopics are the specific aspects within those topics. The abstract discusses both the application of machine learning techniques (reinforcement-based optimization) and sustainable development principles (climate-resilient planning), which are subtopics under their respective topics.\n\nI should also consider the confidence levels. Since reinforcement-based optimization is clearly stated, I'll rate it high. Similarly, climate-resilient planning is explicitly mentioned, so confidence is high there too. The mixed-methods approach is a method, not a subtopic, so I won't include it as a subtopic.\n\nIn summary, the topics are T7 (Sustainable Development) and T1 (Machine Learning), with T10 (Public Health) being less prominent. The subtopics are reinforcement-based optimization and climate-resilient planning. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring proportions sum to 100% and confidence ratings reflect the explicit mentions in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Climate Change Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of reinforcement-based optimization, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on temporal decision-making and online safety in the context of sports. It mentions theoretical frameworks from multiple disciplines, focusing on how time-inconsistent preferences affect online safety behaviors. The study uses a novel theoretical model to explore the conflict between immediate gratification and future-oriented prudence. It identifies present-biased preferences as a key factor influencing risky online behaviors and suggests that external cues can mitigate these effects. The implications for online platform design and policy are also discussed.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content of the abstract to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for TOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\n1. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The abstract heavily discusses decision-making, time preferences, and cognitive biases, which are core elements of Behavioral Economics. The study's focus on how psychological factors influence online safety decisions aligns with this topic. The proportion of the abstract dedicated to this is significant, around 70%.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: While the abstract doesn't explicitly mention public health, it does discuss online safety and its implications for the well-being of sports enthusiasts, which can be related to public health concerns. However, this connection is more tangential, so I'll estimate a 30% proportion here.\n\nNext, for SUBTOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\n- **Decision Making (from T8)**: The study revolves around how individuals make decisions regarding online safety, influenced by their time preferences. This is a clear subtopic under Behavioral Economics.\n\n- **Cognitive Biases (from T8)**: The mention of present-biased preferences is a cognitive bias, which is a subtopic within Behavioral Economics.\n\nI don't see any evidence of other subtopics from the codebook, such as those related to Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, or Digital Security. The focus remains on decision-making and cognitive biases within Behavioral Economics.\n\nNow, I'll structure the JSON response accordingly, ensuring that the topics sum to 100% and that the subtopics are accurately identified with appropriate confidence levels.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses decision-making and cognitive biases within the context of online safety, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how professional sports have shifted towards data-driven decision-making. It mentions the use of intertemporal choice theory and policy frameworks to optimize player decisions. Key terms include \"intertemporal choice,\" \"delay discounting,\" \"temporal sensitivity,\" and \"policy-based interventions.\" The study's findings relate to how these factors influence player decisions and outcomes.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). The subtopics under each are listed, so I need to see which ones match the abstract.\n\nFirst, the abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, so T1 is out. Sustainable Development (T7) involves renewable energy, climate change, etc., which aren't discussed here. Digital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) also don't seem relevant.\n\nThat leaves Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract uses terms like \"intertemporal choice,\" \"delay discounting,\" and \"temporal sensitivity,\" which are directly related to Behavioral Economics. The study's focus on decision-making under uncertainty and the use of policy frameworks aligns with this topic.\n\nNow, for subtopics under T8: the abstract specifically mentions \"intertemporal choice,\" which is one of the subtopics. There's also a mention of policy-based interventions, but that's more about the application rather than a subtopic. So, the main subtopic here is \"Intertemporal Choice.\"\n\nI should estimate the proportion of the abstract related to Behavioral Economics. The entire study is centered around decision-making theories within Behavioral Economics, so it's about 80% of the content. The remaining 20% might be about the application or context, but since the core analysis is on the decision-making framework, 80% seems accurate.\n\nConfidence for T8 is high, a 4/5, because the abstract clearly uses concepts from Behavioral Economics. For the subtopic, \"Intertemporal Choice\" is explicitly mentioned, so confidence is 5/5.\n\nI don't see any other topics or subtopics from the codebook present in the abstract. Therefore, the final analysis should only include T8 and the subtopic \"Intertemporal Choice.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.8,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Intertemporal Choice\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses decision-making under uncertainty using intertemporal choice theory, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study examining caregivers' decision-making processes in childcare settings. It combines insights from psychological theories and computational models. The study involves caregivers making decisions in a laboratory setting, using a computational framework to analyze their choices. The findings highlight factors like emotional arousal, cognitive biases, and past experiences influencing decisions. The implications suggest developing decision-support tools and training programs.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for TOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\n1. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The abstract discusses decision-making processes, weighing risks and rewards, and factors like cognitive biases and emotional arousal. These elements are central to Behavioral Economics, which studies how psychological and cognitive factors affect economic decisions. The study's focus on how caregivers make decisions aligns with this topic.\n\n2. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract mentions using a \"novel computational framework\" to analyze decision-making. While it doesn't explicitly state machine learning, computational frameworks in this context could involve machine learning techniques, especially since the codebook includes computational models under Machine Learning. However, the mention is less direct, so the proportion is lower.\n\n3. **Public Health (T10)**: The study's implications for developing tools and training programs to improve outcomes in childcare settings relate to public health, which focuses on population health and interventions. However, this aspect is more about the application rather than the core focus of the study, so the proportion is lower.\n\nNext, for SUBTOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\n- **Cognitive Biases (T8.3)**: The abstract explicitly mentions cognitive biases as a factor influencing decision-making. This is a direct match to the subtopic under Behavioral Economics.\n\n- **Decision Making (T8.1)**: The entire study revolves around the decision-making processes of caregivers, which is a core subtopic in Behavioral Economics.\n\nI don't see evidence for other subtopics like Risk Assessment or Social Preferences, as they aren't mentioned in the abstract. Similarly, while the computational framework might relate to Machine Learning, there's no specific subtopic mentioned beyond the general use of a computational model.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm very confident about Behavioral Economics and its subtopics since they are central to the study. The confidence for Machine Learning is moderate because the abstract doesn't explicitly state it, and Public Health is lower as it's more about the application.\n\nI need to ensure that the proportions sum to 100%. Behavioral Economics is the primary focus, so it gets the highest proportion. Machine Learning and Public Health are secondary, so their proportions are lower.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics and subtopics, their proportions, confidence levels, and a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses decision-making processes influenced by cognitive biases, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

The abstract spends a good chunk discussing the application of machine learning, explaining the SVM model and its accuracy. That's probably about 60% of the content. The rest, about 40%, covers the public health aspects, like policy implications and the multidisciplinary approach.\n\nFor confidence, I'm pretty sure about Machine Learning (T1) because it's clearly mentioned with specific algorithms. So, confidence 5. Public Health (T10) is a bit less direct, but the discussion on policy and integrating multiple disciplines supports it. Confidence 4.\n\nNow, subtopics. Under Machine Learning (T1), they used a support vector machine, which is a type of supervised learning. So, the subtopic is Supervised Learning. Confidence is high, 5. For Public Health (T10), the study discusses policy implications and contributing to existing literature, which falls under Health Systems. Confidence 4.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics mentioned. They don't talk about neural networks or reinforcement learning, so those aren't applicable. Similarly, other subtopics under Public Health like Epidemiology aren't discussed.\n\nSo, the topics are T1 and T10, with proportions 60% and 40%, and subtopics Supervised Learning and Health Systems.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Systems\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically supervised learning through SVM, which falls under T1.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study in competitive athletics that uses algorithmic decision-making to optimize performance. It mentions a survey of athletes and coaches, and the results show improvements in performance metrics. The study highlights the integration of computational methods with athletic performance, suggesting applications beyond sports.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match the content to the topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the study uses algorithmic decision-making, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions terms like \"algorithmic decision-making\" and \"adaptive framework,\" which are methodologies within Machine Learning. So, T1 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the study's broader implications are discussed, mentioning adaptability in dynamic environments. This touches on Behavioral Economics (T8), as it involves decision-making and how individuals adapt their behaviors based on situational factors. The abstract doesn't delve deeply into this, but it's mentioned in the context of broader applications.\n\nNow, considering subtopics under T1, the abstract specifically talks about \"algorithmic decision-making,\" which aligns with \"Decision Making\" under T8. However, since the primary focus is on the algorithmic approach, the subtopic here is more about the application of Machine Learning rather than a specific subtopic within it. Therefore, the subtopic identified is \"Decision Making\" from T8.\n\nI should also note the proportions. The majority of the abstract is about Machine Learning, so T1 takes up about 70%. The mention of Behavioral Economics is more peripheral, so T8 gets 30%. Confidence levels are high for T1 (4/5) and moderate for T8 (3/5).\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily discusses Machine Learning with a minor touch on Behavioral Economics, and the subtopic is \"Decision Making.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of algorithmic decision-making, which falls under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the prevention of injuries in team-based sports. It mentions that traditional methods like educational programs and physical conditioning aren't very effective. The study uses advanced data analytics, specifically machine learning techniques like deep neural networks and gradient boosting, to analyze survey data from 1,200 athletes. The findings highlight risk factors and suggest targeted interventions, emphasizing the role of machine learning in sports analytics.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract explicitly mentions machine learning algorithms, deep neural networks, and gradient boosting. These are all subtopics under T1. The discussion of data analytics techniques and their application in injury prevention clearly falls under Machine Learning. \n\nNext, I'll consider Public Health (T10). The study is about injury prevention in sports, which relates to public health concerns, particularly in the context of population health and health promotion. The focus on developing strategies to prevent injuries aligns with public health objectives. \n\nSustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), and Digital Security (T9) don't seem relevant here. The abstract doesn't discuss environmental issues, economic decision-making, or digital security concerns.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The majority of the content revolves around the application of machine learning techniques, which is central to the study's methodology and findings. Public Health is the context but is secondary to the technical methods used. So, I'd allocate about 70% to Machine Learning and 30% to Public Health.\n\nFor subtopics under Machine Learning, the abstract specifically mentions deep neural networks and gradient boosting, which fall under Neural Networks and Supervised Learning. These are key subtopics within T1. \n\nI'm confident about the identification of Machine Learning as the primary topic, with a high confidence score. Public Health is a secondary topic, so my confidence is slightly lower but still strong. The subtopics are clearly mentioned, so confidence in their identification is high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.7,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.3,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of machine learning techniques (neural networks and supervised learning) to analyze injury data, which falls under the Machine Learning (T1) topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that combines disease surveillance with advanced identification protocols in the advertising domain. It mentions using machine learning algorithms and techniques like facial recognition. The study's methodology includes a mixed-methods approach, combining data from online platforms with epidemiological models. The findings highlight improvements in disease detection accuracy and reductions in false positives using these technologies.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to map these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract clearly involves Public Health (T10) because it's about disease surveillance, epidemiology, and interventions. The discussion of disease outbreaks, surveillance systems, and health security all fall under this topic. The proportion here is significant since the entire study is about improving disease surveillance, which is a core aspect of public health.\n\nNext, the study uses Machine Learning (T1). They mention machine learning algorithms specifically, which is a direct indicator of this topic. The subtopic here is Supervised Learning, as the context suggests the use of labeled data for improving detection rates and reducing false positives. The proportion for Machine Learning is moderate since it's a tool used within the broader public health framework.\n\nThe abstract also touches on Behavioral Economics (T8) through the mention of behavioral analysis in the identification protocols. This suggests that the study considers how behaviors influence disease spread, which is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics, specifically Decision Making. However, this is a minor aspect compared to the main focus on public health and machine learning.\n\nI don't see evidence for Sustainable Development (T7) or Digital Security (T9) in the abstract. The focus isn't on environmental sustainability or cybersecurity, so these topics aren't applicable.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: Public Health is the primary focus, taking up about 60% of the abstract. Machine Learning is a significant method used, contributing around 30%. Behavioral Economics is a smaller part, maybe 10%.\n\nFor confidence, I'm very confident about Public Health (5/5) and Machine Learning (4/5) since they are clearly discussed. Behavioral Economics is a bit less certain but still present (3/5).\n\nIn terms of subtopics, Supervised Learning is clearly mentioned with machine learning, so that's a 4/5 confidence. Decision Making under Behavioral Economics is a bit more inferred, so 3/5 confidence.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while subtopics are the specific methods or areas within those fields. For example, Machine Learning is the topic, and Supervised Learning is the subtopic.\n\nI think I've covered all relevant points. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, making sure to only include the identified topics and subtopics with their respective proportions and confidences.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses disease surveillance and interventions, which fall under Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about evaluating the effectiveness of online promotional strategies, specifically looking at risk-adjusted content exposure. It mentions a quasi-experimental approach and a mixed-methods methodology. The findings discuss how risk-adjusted content affects advertisement recall and preference, and it also touches on implications for advertisers and platforms.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present. The codebook has five topics: Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nThe abstract doesn't mention anything about machine learning techniques, so T1 is out. Sustainable Development (T7) is about environmental and resource management, which doesn't seem relevant here. Digital Security (T9) deals with cybersecurity and privacy, which isn't the focus of this study. Public Health (T10) is about health-related issues, which also doesn't fit.\n\nThat leaves Behavioral Economics (T8). The study discusses how risk-adjusted content affects viewer behavior, which relates to decision-making and preferences. The subtopics under T8 include Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, and Intertemporal Choice. The abstract specifically mentions risk-adjusted content and its impact on viewer behavior, which points to Risk Assessment and Decision Making as relevant subtopics.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from the codebook that fit. The study's focus is on how content affects user decisions, which is squarely within Behavioral Economics. There's no mention of other areas like cybersecurity or public health interventions.\n\nSo, the main topic is Behavioral Economics (T8), and the subtopics are Risk Assessment and Decision Making. I'm pretty confident about this because the abstract clearly discusses how content exposure affects user behavior, which aligns with Behavioral Economics concepts.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the impact of risk-adjusted content exposure on advertisement effectiveness, which relates to Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how modern technology is threatening the sanctity of marriage. It talks about couples facing risks due to digital practices and examines the relationship between policy frameworks and marital relationships. The study uses a correlational methodology, looks at legislative provisions, technological advancements, and marital dynamics. It finds that many couples are compromising their relationship security through digital practices and experiences breaches. The study suggests policy reforms and collaboration among policymakers, tech developers, and therapists.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics fit.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be about policy and frameworks, which isn't directly listed. However, the closest topic is T10, Public Health, which includes policy development and frameworks. The abstract discusses policy reform, legislative provisions, and the need for holistic policy approaches, which aligns with Public Health's subtopics like Health Systems and Policy Development.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions technology and digital practices, which could relate to Digital Security (T9). However, the focus isn't on cybersecurity measures but more on how technology affects relationships and policies. So, T9 might not be the primary topic here.\n\nThe study's methodology is correlational, which is a research method but doesn't directly tie to any specific topic in the codebook. The main focus is on policy and its impact on relationships, which falls under Public Health.\n\nSo, the primary topic is T10, Public Health, with a significant portion of the abstract discussing policy frameworks and their implications. The proportion is about 80% since most of the content revolves around policy and its reforms. The confidence is high, around 4/5, because the connection is clear.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract discusses policy development and the need for integrating relationship considerations into existing structures. This points to the subtopic \"Policy Development\" under Public Health. The confidence here is also high, around 4/5, as the abstract explicitly talks about policy reform and frameworks.\n\nI don't see evidence for other topics like Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, or Behavioral Economics. The focus is on policy and its relation to marital relationships, which fits under Public Health.\n\nTherefore, the analysis concludes that T10 is the main topic with a significant portion of the abstract, and the subtopic is \"Policy Development.\"\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Policy Development\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses policy frameworks and their impact on marital relationships, aligning with Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how cyber threats affect marital relationships. It mentions the adoption of information protection measures and their impact on relationship stability. The study uses a correlational design, survey data, and statistical analysis. It also references social learning theory as the theoretical framework.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Digital Security (T9) because the abstract focuses on cyber threats, secure communication, and online payment methods. The discussion of information protection measures and their implementation clearly falls under Digital Security. The proportion of the abstract related to this topic is high, probably around 70%, as most of the content deals with these measures and their effects.\n\nNext, the study's implications for policymakers and individuals suggest a connection to Public Health (T10). The abstract mentions the need for policies and interventions, which is a key aspect of Public Health. This topic might take up about 20% of the abstract, as it's discussed in the context of broader implications.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is another possible topic because the study looks at how behaviors related to digital security affect relationships. However, the abstract doesn't delve deeply into behavioral economics theories or methodologies, so this might be a secondary topic with a lower confidence rating.\n\nNow, for subtopics under Digital Security (T9), the abstract mentions secure communication practices, online harassment, and secure online payment methods. These correspond to the subtopics of Cybersecurity, Threat Detection, and Privacy Enhancing Technologies. Each of these subtopics is clearly discussed in the abstract, so their confidence ratings are high.\n\nI should also consider if any other subtopics from other topics are relevant. For example, under Public Health, subtopics like Health Promotion or Health Systems might be tangentially related, but the abstract doesn't explicitly mention them. Similarly, Behavioral Economics subtopics like Decision Making or Cognitive Biases aren't directly addressed.\n\nIn summary, the primary topic is Digital Security with significant subtopics, followed by Public Health and a minor mention of Behavioral Economics. The disambiguation explanation should clarify how the main focus is on Digital Security and its subtopics, with other topics playing a supporting role.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The primary focus of the abstract is on Digital Security (T9), as it discusses cyber threats, secure communication practices, and online payment methods.

It mentions using a quasi-experimental design and discusses several cognitive biases like the availability heuristic, anchoring effect, and framing effect. The implications are for platform designers, policymakers, and marketers.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics. The main areas discussed are cognitive biases and decision-making, which fall under Behavioral Economics. The subtopics mentioned are availability heuristic, anchoring effect, and framing effect, which are all part of the Cognitive Biases subtopic under Behavioral Economics.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how digital platforms have changed information consumption and engagement, focusing on the psychological mechanisms influencing decision-making on social media. It mentions a quasi-experimental design examining how different information formats affect cognitive processing and decision outcomes. The study finds that visually appealing and interactive formats lead to better engagement and decision outcomes, while dense text-heavy formats do the opposite. It also notes the influence of prior experiences and expectations. The implications are for designing digital platforms and decision-making strategies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main focus is on psychological mechanisms and decision-making influenced by social media. This seems to fall under Behavioral Economics (T8), as it deals with how psychological factors affect economic decisions. The abstract uses terms like \"decision-making,\" \"cognitive processing,\" and \"engagement,\" which are all related to Behavioral Economics.\n\nNext, the study employs a quasi-experimental design, which is a research method, but it doesn't directly tie to any of the other topics like Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). The focus isn't on technology application but rather on human behavior and decision-making processes.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract specifically discusses \"decision-making\" and \"cognitive processing,\" which are subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8). There's also mention of how prior experiences and expectations influence susceptibility, which touches on \"Cognitive Biases\" and \"Decision Making\" subtopics.\n\nI don't see any elements related to Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health. The study is purely about human behavior in the context of information consumption, so T8 is the only relevant topic.\n\nIn terms of proportions, the entire abstract is about Behavioral Economics, so it should be 100%. Confidence is high since the focus is clear and aligned with the subtopics provided.\n\nSo, the final analysis is that the abstract is entirely about Behavioral Economics (T8) with subtopics like Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on psychological mechanisms influencing decision-making in social media contexts, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

On the environmental side, it talks about minimizing ecological footprints and sustainable practices, which falls under sustainable development.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the topics that match are T9 (Digital Security) and T7 (Sustainable Development). The abstract doesn't mention any other topics like Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Public Health, so I can exclude those.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion each topic takes. The abstract seems to balance both network security and environmental issues. I'd say about 50% each. \n\nFor subtopics, under T9, the abstract discusses network vulnerabilities and standardized protocols, which fits under Cybersecurity. Under T7, it talks about sustainable practices and resource management, which aligns with Environmental Monitoring and Resource Management.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications since the abstract explicitly mentions these areas.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of interconnected technologies in high-stakes environments like professional sports. It mentions potential threats to data integrity and operational continuity. The study uses a qualitative approach, synthesizing insights from cybersecurity and resource management to develop a risk mitigation framework. They examined five sports organizations implementing threat detection and resource optimization strategies.\n\nThe key themes identified are proactive threat detection, holistic resource optimization, and stakeholder engagement. The implications suggest applications beyond sports, emphasizing the integration of cybersecurity and resource management. The study contributes to risk management in high-stakes environments and highlights the importance of considering human and organizational factors alongside technological solutions.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract mentions cybersecurity and resource management. Cybersecurity is a subtopic under Digital Security (T9), and resource management is a subtopic under Sustainable Development (T7). The study integrates these two areas, so both T7 and T9 are relevant.\n\nNext, the abstract discusses risk mitigation strategies, which involves understanding and managing risks. This touches on the concept of risk assessment, which is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics (T8). However, the primary focus seems to be more on the integration of cybersecurity and resource management rather than the behavioral aspects of risk assessment. So, T8 might be a secondary topic.\n\nLooking at the proportion of the abstract, the majority of the content is about cybersecurity and resource management. The integration of these two areas is the core of the study, so T7 and T9 each take up a significant portion. The mention of risk assessment is present but less emphasized, so it might take up a smaller proportion.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract explicitly mentions threat detection (a subtopic under Digital Security) and resource optimization (a subtopic under Sustainable Development). These are directly discussed in the context of the framework developed.\n\nI should also consider the confidence levels. The presence of cybersecurity and resource management is clear, so confidence for T9 and T7 is high. The mention of risk assessment is there but not as central, so confidence is moderate.\n\nPutting it all together, the topics are T9 (Digital Security) and T7 (Sustainable Development), each taking about 45% and 40% respectively, with T8 (Behavioral Economics) at 15%. The subtopics are Threat Detection and Resource Management, each with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 45,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 15,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cybersecurity and resource management, which are subtopics under Digital Security (T9) and Sustainable Development (T7), respectively.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses online communities, their benefits, and the associated risks like misinformation and data breaches. It mentions using advanced data analysis techniques, specifically clustering algorithms, to identify patterns and community typologies. The study's implications focus on improving user well-being and data protection.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the use of clustering algorithms falls under Machine Learning (T1). The abstract explicitly mentions \"advanced clustering algorithms,\" which is a subtopic under T1. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, the study's focus on user well-being and data protection ties into Public Health (T10). The abstract discusses the impact on individuals and communities, which aligns with public health concerns. The proposed safeguards like data anonymization also relate to protecting user well-being, which is a public health aspect.\n\nNow, considering the subtopics, the clustering algorithms mentioned are a specific technique within Machine Learning. So, the subtopic here is \"Clustering Algorithms,\" which is part of T1.\n\nI don't see any mention of topics like Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Digital Security (T9). The focus is more on the application of machine learning techniques and public health implications rather than digital security measures or behavioral economic theories.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends a significant portion discussing the data analysis methods, which is where the machine learning aspect comes in. The rest of the abstract deals with the implications for user well-being, which falls under public health. I'd estimate about 60% on Machine Learning and 40% on Public Health.\n\nConfidence-wise, I'm quite sure about Machine Learning being a key topic here, so confidence is high. Public Health is also clearly present, but since it's more about the implications rather than the methodology, the confidence is still high but maybe a bit less than T1.\n\nSo, summarizing:\n- Topics: T1 (60%) and T10 (40%)\n- Subtopics: Clustering Algorithms (from T1)\n\nI don't see any other subtopics mentioned in the abstract, so only one subtopic is identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Clustering Algorithms\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of clustering algorithms, which falls under the Machine Learning topic (T1).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online platforms affect users' well-being. It mentions the relationship between online engagement, individual characteristics, and emotional states. The study uses a correlational approach and machine learning techniques. It also talks about contextualized information, like location-based and time-sensitive content, and how these influence user experiences.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the abstract mentions machine learning techniques in the context of analyzing user behaviors. This clearly falls under the \"Machine Learning\" topic (T1). The subtopics under T1 include methods like supervised learning, but the abstract doesn't specify a particular subtopic, so I'll note T1 as the topic.\n\nNext, the study is about user well-being and the impact of online interactions, which relates to public health (T10). The subtopics under T10 include epidemiology, health promotion, etc., but the abstract doesn't delve into these specifics. Therefore, T10 is the appropriate topic here.\n\nI don't see any mention of sustainable development (T7), behavioral economics (T8), or digital security (T9) in the abstract. The focus is on user well-being and the methods used, not on environmental issues, economic behavior, or security concerns.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing the impact on well-being, which would be under T10. The methods section, which includes machine learning, is also substantial. I'd estimate about 60% on T10 and 40% on T1. \n\nFor confidence, I'm quite sure about T10 since the study's primary focus is on well-being. T1 is also clear because of the explicit mention of machine learning techniques, so confidence is high for both.\n\nRegarding subtopics, the abstract doesn't specify any particular subtopics beyond the main topics. It doesn't mention specific methodologies like supervised learning or aspects like health promotion. Therefore, no subtopics are identified.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily discusses public health (T10) and machine learning (T1), with no subtopics explicitly mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the impact of online interactions on user well-being, which falls under Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses environmental degradation and the role of individual actions, particularly within educational institutions. It focuses on psychological factors influencing environmentally conscious decision-making among students and faculty. The study uses a survey of 500 participants and identifies cognitive patterns like the availability heuristic and affect heuristic. It also mentions environmental cues and the impact of social norms on pro-environmental behavior.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7) because the abstract deals with environmental issues and sustainable practices. The study's focus on individual actions and institutional changes aligns with sustainable development goals.\n\nNext, the subtopics under Sustainable Development include Environmental Monitoring, which doesn't seem to fit here. However, the study discusses the impact of environmental cues and social norms, which relate to the broader aspects of sustainable development but aren't directly a subtopic. Alternatively, the study's focus on psychological factors might fall under Behavioral Economics (T8), specifically the subtopics Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n\nWait, the codebook's subtopics for Sustainable Development don't directly match the psychological aspects discussed. So, perhaps the main topic is Sustainable Development (T7) with a focus on the psychological factors, which might not be a direct subtopic but relates to the broader area.\n\nAlternatively, considering the psychological factors, Behavioral Economics (T8) could be a secondary topic. The abstract discusses cognitive heuristics and decision-making, which are core to Behavioral Economics. The subtopics here would be Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n\nSo, the primary topic is Sustainable Development (T7) with a significant portion of the abstract discussing the role of institutions and environmental cues. The secondary topic is Behavioral Economics (T8), focusing on the psychological aspects influencing decisions.\n\nFor proportions, since the abstract is about environmental issues and sustainable practices, Sustainable Development (T7) takes up about 70% of the content. The remaining 30% deals with the psychological factors, falling under Behavioral Economics (T8).\n\nRegarding subtopics, under Behavioral Economics, the subtopics Decision Making and Cognitive Biases are clearly present. The study discusses how cognitive heuristics affect decision-making, which directly relates to these subtopics.\n\nI'm confident about the identification of Sustainable Development as the main topic and Behavioral Economics as the secondary topic. The subtopics are well-supported by the content of the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses sustainable development through the lens of environmental degradation and institutional roles, hence T7 with a high proportion.

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how cognitive biases affect decision-making in educational institutions regarding climate change mitigation. It mentions a survey of educators and administrators, highlighting issues like the availability heuristic and the impact of training on sustainable practices. The study emphasizes the role of educators in promoting sustainable strategies and suggests implications for educational policy.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7) because the abstract focuses on climate change mitigation, resource management, and sustainable practices within schools. The discussion of educators' strategies to reduce environmental impact directly relates to sustainable development.\n\nNext, the abstract also delves into cognitive biases and decision-making, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). The mention of heuristics and their influence on decision-making processes clearly points to this topic.\n\nNow, considering the subtopics, the abstract specifically discusses cognitive biases, which is a subtopic under Behavioral Economics (T8). There's no mention of other subtopics like Decision Making or Risk Assessment, so only Cognitive Biases is relevant here.\n\nI don't see any elements related to Machine Learning (T1), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is purely on sustainable practices and cognitive influences, so those topics aren't applicable.\n\nFor the proportions, the majority of the abstract is about Sustainable Development, as it discusses various strategies and their implementation. However, a significant portion also deals with Behavioral Economics, particularly cognitive biases. I'll estimate that about 60% of the abstract is about Sustainable Development and 40% about Behavioral Economics.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm very certain about Sustainable Development (T7) because the content is directly aligned. For Behavioral Economics (T8), I'm also confident, but since it's a bit more specific, I'll rate it a 4.\n\nSo, the final analysis should include both topics with their respective proportions and confidence levels, along with the relevant subtopic.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the impact of cognitive biases on decision-making in the context of climate change mitigation, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on human decision-making in the context of modern advertising. It mentions psychological and computational mechanisms influencing consumer behavior. They used a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data. The study identifies patterns and biases, looking at contextual influences like social norms and emotional appeals, as well as visual cues affecting cognitive pathways.\n\nThey developed a novel unsupervised clustering algorithm, which was trained on a large dataset of consumer interactions. This algorithm helped predict consumer behavior with 85% accuracy. The study emphasizes the interplay between psychological insights and computational methods, advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the study clearly involves Behavioral Economics (T8) because it examines decision-making processes, biases, and the influence of contextual factors. The discussion of cognitive pathways and biases aligns with subtopics like Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n\nAdditionally, the use of a novel unsupervised clustering algorithm points to Machine Learning (T1). The algorithm is a computational method, specifically an unsupervised learning technique, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning.\n\nI don't see evidence of Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on decision-making and computational methods, not sustainability, security, or public health issues.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends a significant portion discussing the psychological aspects and decision-making processes, which relates to Behavioral Economics. The computational methods, while important, are a tool used in the study rather than the primary focus. So, I'll allocate 70% to Behavioral Economics and 30% to Machine Learning.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about Behavioral Economics (T8) with a confidence of 5. For Machine Learning (T1), since it's a method used but not the main focus, I'll rate it a 4.\n\nSubtopics: The study mentions decision-making processes and cognitive biases, so both Decision Making and Cognitive Biases are relevant. The confidence for these subtopics is high, so I'll rate each at 4.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention reinforcement learning, supervised learning, or other subtopics under Machine Learning beyond unsupervised clustering. Similarly, there's no mention of other Behavioral Economics subtopics like Risk Assessment or Social Preferences beyond what's covered.\n\nSo, the final identification is T8 (Behavioral Economics) and T1 (Machine Learning) with their respective subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses human decision-making processes influenced by psychological and computational factors, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses consumer decision-making in the context of digital media. It mentions psychological mechanisms, heuristics, biases, and social influence. It also talks about machine-based algorithms and their impact on consumer choices. The methods used include a mixed-methods approach with surveys, interviews, and content analysis.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8) because the abstract focuses on heuristics, biases, and decision-making, which are core aspects of this field. The discussion of availability and representativeness heuristics, as well as social influence, directly relates to the subtopics under Behavioral Economics, specifically Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n\nNext, the abstract also touches on Machine Learning (T1) when discussing algorithms used in recommendation systems. However, the focus isn't on the algorithms themselves but on their impact on consumer behavior, which is more of an application rather than a core element of Machine Learning. Therefore, Machine Learning is a secondary topic.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract, so those topics aren't relevant here.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract clearly discusses Decision Making and Cognitive Biases under Behavioral Economics. There's no mention of other subtopics like Risk Assessment or Social Preferences, so those aren't applicable.\n\nIn terms of proportions, Behavioral Economics takes up about 70% of the abstract, while Machine Learning is about 30%. The confidence for Behavioral Economics is high (5/5), and Machine Learning is moderate (3/5) since it's not the primary focus.\n\nSo, the final analysis should reflect these findings, ensuring that the JSON structure accurately captures the identified topics and subtopics with their respective proportions and confidence levels.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses psychological mechanisms, heuristics, and biases in consumer decision-making, which fall under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses the importance of collaborative partnerships between various stakeholders, such as advertisement agencies, community organizations, and environmental groups. It emphasizes how these partnerships can promote pro-environmental behaviors and enhance community well-being. The study highlights factors like co-creation, mutual learning, collective action, inclusive decision-making, and the role of advertisement campaigns in amplifying environmental messages.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, considering the main focus on environmental stewardship, community well-being, and partnerships aimed at addressing environmental degradation and social inequities, the most relevant topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract discusses strategies to meet present needs without compromising the future, which aligns with the description of T7. The subtopics under T7 include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. The abstract doesn't mention renewable energy or climate change directly, but it does talk about environmental stewardship and partnerships, which could relate to Resource Management and Sustainable Cities. However, the primary focus is on collaboration and community well-being, which might not directly map to these subtopics.\n\nNext, the abstract touches on decision-making processes, mutual learning, and collective action. These elements fall under Behavioral Economics (T8), specifically the subtopics of Decision Making and possibly Cognitive Biases. The study examines how stakeholders make decisions and collaborate, which is a core aspect of Behavioral Economics.\n\nLooking at the other topics: Machine Learning (T1) isn't mentioned at all. The abstract doesn't discuss any algorithms or models. Digital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) also aren't relevant here. The focus is on environmental and social aspects, not cybersecurity or health systems.\n\nSo, the two main topics present are Sustainable Development (T7) and Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract is more focused on Sustainable Development, as it's about partnerships and environmental stewardship, which takes up a larger portion of the content. Behavioral Economics is present but to a lesser extent, as it's more about the decision-making processes within these partnerships.\n\nFor subtopics, under Sustainable Development, the abstract discusses partnerships and their impact on environmental quality and social cohesion, which could relate to Resource Management and Sustainable Cities. However, the primary emphasis is on collaboration rather than specific resource management techniques or urban planning. Under Behavioral Economics, the subtopics of Decision Making and possibly Cognitive Biases are relevant, as the study looks at how stakeholders make decisions and interact.\n\nI need to estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. Since the majority of the abstract is about partnerships and their environmental and social impacts, Sustainable Development likely takes up about 70%. Behavioral Economics, while present, is more about the mechanisms within these partnerships, so maybe 30%.\n\nFor confidence levels, I'm quite certain about Sustainable Development (T7) being the primary topic, so a confidence of 4. Behavioral Economics (T8) is present but not as prominently, so a confidence of 3.\n\nRegarding subtopics, under T7, the focus is more on the partnerships and their outcomes rather than specific subtopics like Resource Management or Sustainable Cities.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses an observational study focused on the impact of eco-friendly messaging, specifically green advertising, on influencing lifestyle choices related to energy consumption. It mentions a mixed-methods approach, including both qualitative and quantitative data. The study's findings indicate a significant increase in eco-friendly practices among participants exposed to the campaign. The implications suggest that green advertising can drive behavioral change towards sustainability.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match the content of the abstract to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, I'll consider each topic:\n\n1. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or models. It's focused on behavioral change and advertising, not computational methods. So, T1 is not relevant here.\n\n2. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The study is about promoting eco-friendly practices and sustainability. The abstract discusses environmental sustainability, renewable energy, and reducing energy consumption, all of which fall under sustainable development. This seems to be the primary topic.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The research examines how messaging influences behavior and decision-making, particularly in adopting eco-friendly practices. This touches on behavioral economics, as it looks at how people make choices influenced by external factors like advertising.\n\n4. **Digital Security (T9)**: There's no mention of cybersecurity, privacy, or digital threats in the abstract. The focus is on advertising and behavior, so T9 isn't applicable.\n\n5. **Public Health (T10)**: While the study mentions health benefits indirectly (e.g., benefits to the planet and personal health), it's not centered on public health issues, epidemiology, or health systems. Thus, T10 isn't the main focus.\n\nSo, the two relevant topics are T7 (Sustainable Development) and T8 (Behavioral Economics). \n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each. The abstract extensively discusses the impact of green advertising on sustainable practices, which is a core aspect of Sustainable Development. Behavioral Economics is also a significant component, as the study looks at how messaging affects behavior. I'd say about 60% of the abstract is about Sustainable Development and 40% about Behavioral Economics.\n\nFor confidence, I'm quite certain about T7 since the study is clearly about sustainability. For T8, while it's relevant, the focus is more on the behavioral aspect influenced by advertising, so my confidence is high but slightly less than T7.\n\nNow, moving on to subtopics. The codebook lists subtopics under each identified topic.\n\nUnder T7 (Sustainable Development), the subtopics include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. The abstract mentions the use of renewable energy sources and reducing energy consumption, which directly relates to Renewable Energy and Resource Management. However, the primary focus is on the impact of advertising, so the most relevant subtopic here is Renewable Energy.\n\nUnder T8 (Behavioral Economics), the subtopics are Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, and Intertemporal Choice. The study examines how participants make decisions influenced by advertising, which falls under Decision Making. The emotional resonance and sense of responsibility mentioned also tie into Decision Making within the context of behavioral economics.\n\nI'll rate my confidence in these subtopics as high, given the explicit focus on how messaging affects behavior and the adoption of sustainable practices.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily addresses Sustainable Development with a focus on Renewable Energy and Behavioral Economics with a focus on Decision Making. The topics are distinguished by the broader academic fields, while the subtopics capture the specific aspects within those fields that the study investigates.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the impact of green advertising on promoting sustainable practices, aligning with Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the given codebook. Let's start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about educational institutions promoting eco-friendly behavior by using cognitive biases in experiments. They mention principles like prospect theory and discuss how reframing messages and using visual cues can influence decisions. The study's implications are for creating low-carbon environments and influencing policy.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to identify the main topics and subtopics. The abstract discusses cognitive biases and decision-making, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). It also touches on sustainable development through eco-friendly practices and reducing energy consumption, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7).\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: most of the abstract is about using cognitive biases (Behavioral Economics), so maybe 70%. The sustainable aspect is about 30%. \n\nFor subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions cognitive biases and decision-making, so those are the subtopics under T8.\n\nI'm pretty confident about T8 and T7, so I'll rate them 5 and 4 respectively. The subtopics are clearly mentioned, so confidence is high there too.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of cognitive biases and decision-making principles to encourage eco-friendly behavior, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of energy-efficient technologies in educational institutions and their impact on student learning outcomes. It mentions a multi-disciplinary approach combining laboratory science and behavioral economics. The study conducted an experiment in a lab setting, measuring improvements in STEM subjects. It also looked into students' decision-making processes regarding energy consumption and conservation, linking to sustainability and policy implications.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nFrom the abstract, the main focus is on the impact of energy-efficient technologies, which ties into Sustainable Development (T7). The study's context is about improving learning outcomes and promoting sustainability, which are key aspects of T7. The subtopics under T7 include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. The abstract mentions energy-efficient technologies and their impact on sustainability, so Sustainable Development is definitely a topic.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is also mentioned as part of the multi-disciplinary approach. The study analyzed students' decision-making and behaviors, which falls under T8's subtopics like Decision Making and Cognitive Biases. So, T8 is another topic present.\n\nLooking at the proportion, the abstract spends a significant portion discussing the impact of energy-efficient technologies and sustainability, which would be under T7. The Behavioral Economics aspect is also substantial, especially in the analysis of student behavior. I'd estimate T7 at around 60% and T8 at 40%.\n\nFor subtopics, under T7, the abstract discusses energy-efficient technologies and their impact on sustainability, which relates to Sustainable Cities. Under T8, the focus is on Decision Making and Cognitive Biases as students make choices regarding energy conservation.\n\nI'm confident about T7 and T8 being the main topics, and their respective subtopics. The abstract clearly ties into these areas without mentioning other topics like Machine Learning or Digital Security.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of energy-efficient technologies in educational institutions, focusing on their impact on student learning outcomes and sustainability.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how online platforms can be used for disease surveillance and response. It mentions using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze online data. The study focuses on detecting early warning signs of outbreaks through online signals like search queries, social media sentiment, and symptom reports.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract explicitly mentions machine learning algorithms, which is a clear indicator. The methods section talks about NLP techniques, which fall under machine learning. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, Public Health (T10) is another key topic. The study is about disease surveillance and response, which are core areas in public health. The implications for early warning systems and interventions are discussed, which are part of public health strategies. So, T10 is also present.\n\nNow, I need to estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing the application of machine learning techniques, explaining how these algorithms are used to analyze online data. This takes up about 40% of the content. The rest of the abstract, around 60%, focuses on the public health implications, such as disease surveillance, early warning systems, and policy interventions.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract uses supervised learning techniques, as indicated by the analysis of online data to predict disease outbreaks. So, Supervised Learning is a subtopic here. Additionally, the study applies these techniques to public health surveillance, which is a subtopic under Public Health (T10), specifically Disease Prevention.\n\nI should also consider if any other topics or subtopics are mentioned. There's no mention of sustainable development, behavioral economics, or digital security.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how digital technologies have changed information sharing and its impact on public health, specifically regarding the spread of infectious diseases. It mentions an experiment where participants discussed a fictional outbreak, focusing on how information is shared, especially misinformation. The study highlights the role of social media in amplifying the spread of unverified information and suggests strategies to mitigate this, such as using verified sources.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Public Health (T10). The abstract extensively discusses the spread of diseases, public health implications, and strategies to mitigate disease spread. The entire study is centered around public health outcomes, so this should be the primary topic.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions the use of social media and online information sharing. This relates to Digital Security (T9), particularly focusing on the dissemination of information and its potential risks. However, the discussion on Digital Security is more about the mechanisms of information spread rather than traditional security aspects like cybersecurity or privacy. So, while relevant, it's a secondary topic.\n\nNow, for subtopics under these main topics:\n\nUnder Public Health (T10), the subtopics include Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. The study discusses how misinformation can lead to risky behaviors, which ties into Disease Prevention. Additionally, the emphasis on using verified information sources to promote safe behaviors aligns with Health Promotion.\n\nRegarding Digital Security (T9), the subtopic Environmental Monitoring isn't directly applicable here. Instead, the focus is more on the impact of information dissemination, which isn't a listed subtopic under Digital Security. Therefore, the main subtopics are under Public Health.\n\nI should also consider the proportions. The majority of the abstract is about Public Health, so it should take a higher proportion, say 70%. Digital Security is mentioned but in a supporting role, so 30% seems appropriate.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about Public Health (T10) as it's central to the study. For Digital Security (T9), while relevant, it's a bit of a stretch since the focus isn't on traditional security aspects but more on information spread, so a confidence level of 4.\n\nFor subtopics, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion are clearly discussed, so confidence is high (4 each). There's no direct mention of other subtopics like Cybersecurity or Privacy, so they aren't applicable here.\n\nIn summary, the analysis identifies Public Health as the primary topic with significant portions discussing Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. Digital Security is a secondary topic, but its subtopics aren't directly addressed beyond the broader context of information dissemination.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the impact of online information sharing on public health, particularly in the context of disease spread and prevention.

It mentions cognitive biases such as the availability heuristic, affect heuristic, and sunk cost fallacy. These terms are central to understanding how people make decisions, which falls under Behavioral Economics. \n\nLooking at the codebook, Behavioral Economics (T8) is defined as the study of how psychological, social, cognitive, and emotional factors influence economic decisions. The subtopics under T8 include Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, and Intertemporal Choice. The abstract specifically talks about cognitive biases, which is a direct subtopic of T8.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is entirely on decision-making processes influenced by psychological factors, which aligns with Behavioral Economics.\n\nFor the proportion, the entire abstract is dedicated to Behavioral Economics, so it's 100%.

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the cultivation of prudence in the context of physical activity. It examines decision-making processes, factors influencing prudence such as perceived physical competence, self-efficacy, and situational factors. It also looks at how these factors relate to physical activity choices and well-being.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nThe abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, so T1 is out. Sustainable Development (T7) is about environmental and resource management, which isn't directly addressed here. Digital Security (T9) deals with cybersecurity and privacy, which isn't relevant either.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) focuses on how psychological and social factors influence economic decisions. The abstract discusses decision-making, cognitive processes like self-efficacy, and how these influence physical activity choices. This seems to fit under Behavioral Economics, specifically the subtopics of Decision Making and Cognitive Biases.\n\nPublic Health (T10) involves population health, disease prevention, and health systems. While the study touches on health outcomes, the primary focus is on the decision-making processes related to prudence, which aligns more with Behavioral Economics.\n\nSo, the main topic is Behavioral Economics (T8). The subtopics mentioned are Decision Making and Cognitive Biases, both of which are clearly discussed in the context of physical activity decisions.\n\nI'm confident that T8 is the correct topic here, and the subtopics are well-supported by the abstract's content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on decision-making processes and cognitive factors influencing physical activity choices, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that uses computational modeling and privacy-conscious data analysis to enhance the inclusivity of physical activity initiatives. It mentions developing a framework that integrates pattern recognition and data protection. The research uses mixed methods, combining quantitative analysis of datasets with qualitative insights from stakeholders. The findings highlight improvements in model accuracy, privacy attitudes, and the impact of privacy-enhancing technologies on trust and engagement. The implications suggest the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract talks about computational modeling, pattern recognition, and data analysis. These are all related to Machine Learning (T1). The study uses advanced techniques, which fall under the broader Machine Learning topic. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, the study emphasizes privacy-conscious data analysis and privacy-enhancing technologies. These aspects relate to Digital Security (T9), specifically focusing on privacy. Therefore, T9 is another relevant topic.\n\nThe abstract doesn't mention any elements related to Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10). The focus is on technology and privacy, not on sustainability, behavioral aspects, or public health systems.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the study uses pattern recognition, which is a technique within this field. However, the codebook doesn't list pattern recognition as a subtopic. The closest subtopics are Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, etc., but the abstract doesn't specify which one. Therefore, I can't confidently assign a subtopic under T1.\n\nUnder Digital Security (T9), the study discusses privacy-conscious data analysis and privacy-enhancing technologies. The subtopic Privacy Enhancing Technologies is explicitly mentioned, so that's a clear match.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The abstract spends more time discussing the computational modeling and its impact on inclusivity, which relates to Machine Learning. However, a significant portion also deals with privacy aspects, which ties into Digital Security. I'd estimate T1 at 60% and T9 at 40%.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about T1 and T9, so 5 each. For subtopics, since Privacy Enhancing Technologies is clearly mentioned, confidence is high (5). Pattern recognition isn't a listed subtopic, so I can't assign it, hence no subtopic under T1.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses computational modeling and pattern recognition, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about a study that combines AI with fitness. The first thing I notice is the mention of artificial intelligence and machine learning. The abstract talks about using AI to create a framework called 'AI-Fit' which uses both supervised and unsupervised learning. That clearly points to the Machine Learning topic, specifically the subtopics of Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.\n\nNext, the study focuses on promoting inclusive and equitable exercise practices. They mention addressing systemic inequalities and empowering marginalized communities. This seems to tie into Sustainable Development, particularly the subtopic of Social Equity. The emphasis on inclusivity and reducing disparities aligns well with this area.\n\nI also see that the abstract discusses the application of AI in a real-world setting, testing the framework with participants from diverse backgrounds. This practical application aspect reinforces the Machine Learning topic, as it's about implementing machine learning techniques in a fitness context.\n\nLooking at the other topics in the codebook, I don't see any mention of Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, or Public Health. The focus is more on the AI methodology and its impact on social equity, so those other topics don't seem relevant here.\n\nFor the proportions, the majority of the abstract is about Machine Learning, especially since it details the framework and the learning algorithms used. Sustainable Development comes into play with the discussion on inclusivity and equity, but it's a bit less emphasized compared to the technical aspects of AI.\n\nI'm pretty confident about identifying Machine Learning as the main topic because of the explicit use of machine learning terms. Sustainable Development is a bit more inferred from the context of inclusivity, so my confidence is a bit lower there but still solid.\n\nIn terms of subtopics, Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning are directly mentioned, so those are clear. Social Equity is a subtopic under Sustainable Development, and while it's not explicitly named, the context supports it.\n\nI don't think there are any overlapping terms or ambiguities here. The abstract clearly discusses AI and its application in making fitness more inclusive, which maps neatly to the codebook's topics and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Unsupervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning techniques (supervised and unsupervised learning) in the context of fitness, clearly indicating the Machine Learning topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses data-driven advertising, focusing on using clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. It mentions applying theoretical frameworks from data analysis, which suggests a connection to machine learning. The study's methodology involves clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction, both of which are subtopics under Machine Learning (T1). \n\nLooking at the codebook, Machine Learning (T1) includes subtopics like Clustering (which is part of Unsupervised Learning) and Dimensionality Reduction. The abstract doesn't mention any other topics from the codebook like Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). Therefore, the only relevant topic is T1.\n\nFor the proportion, the entire abstract revolves around these machine learning techniques, so I'll allocate 100% to T1 with a high confidence level of 5. \n\nRegarding subtopics, the abstract explicitly uses clustering and dimensionality reduction. These are both subtopics under Machine Learning. Clustering falls under Unsupervised Learning, and dimensionality reduction is another key technique in the same area. I'll note both with a confidence of 5 each since they are clearly mentioned.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The study is about advertising optimization using machine learning methods, so the broader topic is Machine Learning, and the specific techniques used are the subtopics. There's no overlap with other domains like Sustainable Development or Public Health here.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to Machine Learning as the primary topic, with clustering and dimensionality reduction as the key subtopics. No other topics from the codebook are relevant in this context.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Unsupervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Dimensionality Reduction\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques, which are subtopics under Machine Learning (T1).

Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses the application of advanced computational models, specifically machine learning algorithms, to optimize advertisement engagement. It mentions the use of unsupervised pattern recognition techniques, which are a type of machine learning method. The study also talks about interdisciplinary collaboration between computer science, sociology, and marketing, indicating a focus on how these fields intersect to improve advertising strategies.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). From the abstract, the primary focus is on machine learning techniques applied to advertisement optimization. There's no mention of sustainability, behavioral economics, digital security, or public health issues. Therefore, the only relevant topic here is Machine Learning (T1).\n\nNext, I need to determine the proportion of the abstract dedicated to Machine Learning. The abstract extensively discusses the use of machine learning algorithms, unsupervised pattern recognition, and how these techniques are applied to improve advertisement engagement. It also covers the methodology, findings, and implications related to machine learning. Given the detailed discussion, I estimate that about 80% of the abstract is focused on Machine Learning. The remaining 20% covers the interdisciplinary approach and the application context, which don't fall under the predefined topics.\n\nFor confidence, since the abstract clearly and repeatedly mentions machine learning and its techniques, I rate my confidence at 5.\n\nMoving on to subtopics, the codebook lists subtopics under each main topic. Under Machine Learning (T1), the subtopics include Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Transfer Learning. The abstract specifically mentions \"unsupervised pattern recognition techniques,\" which directly corresponds to the subtopic \"Unsupervised Learning.\" There's no mention of the other subtopics, so only Unsupervised Learning is applicable here. My confidence in this identification is high, so I rate it at 5.\n\nIn summary, the abstract primarily discusses Machine Learning with a focus on Unsupervised Learning.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about applying advanced statistical models to study spousal interactions and predict partnership stability. They use large datasets of marital communication records and develop a framework that integrates pattern recognition with relational data analysis. The findings relate to communication dynamics, emotional expression, and conflict resolution strategies. They also mention implications for couples therapy and relationship counseling.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present. The codebook includes Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions statistical models and pattern recognition, which are related to Machine Learning. However, it doesn't specify any subtopics like Neural Networks or Supervised Learning. So, I think T1 is present but not in a major way.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. The abstract is about relationships, not sustainability or environmental issues.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is about how psychological factors influence economic decisions. The study looks at emotional expression and conflict resolution, which are behavioral aspects. This seems relevant, and the abstract spends a good portion discussing these factors, so T8 is definitely present.\n\nDigital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) don't seem applicable. The study isn't about cybersecurity or public health issues.\n\nSo, the main topics are T1 and T8. T1 is about 30% of the abstract, focusing on the methods used. T8 is about 70%, focusing on the behavioral aspects and their impact on relationships.\n\nFor subtopics, under T1, the abstract uses statistical models and pattern recognition, which are part of Machine Learning. Under T8, the study looks at decision-making (like predicting dissolution) and emotional expression, which relates to cognitive biases and decision-making processes. So, the subtopics are \"Pattern Recognition\" under T1 and \"Decision Making\" and \"Cognitive Biases\" under T8.\n\nI'm pretty confident about T8 being the main topic, so confidence is high. T1 is present but not the focus, so confidence is moderate. The subtopics are clearly related, so their confidence ratings are high.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Pattern Recognition\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of statistical models and pattern recognition, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that uses advanced data analysis techniques to predict marital stability. They used a dataset of 10,000 couples with 50 variables. The methodology includes unsupervised learning and anomaly detection. They found that 20 variables significantly predict stability and developed a classification model using autoencoders and k-means clustering. They also applied anomaly detection to find unusual patterns.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics match.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Machine Learning (T1) because the study uses techniques like unsupervised learning, anomaly detection, autoencoders, and k-means clustering. These are all subtopics under Machine Learning. The abstract is heavily focused on these methods, so I'll estimate the proportion as 80% with high confidence (4/5).\n\nNext, the study's subject is about matrimonial stability, which relates to human behavior and decision-making. This falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). The variables include factors like relationship satisfaction and communication skills, which are behavioral aspects. The proportion here is about 20%, and I'm fairly confident (3/5) because it's more about the application rather than the core methodology.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract mentions unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, both of which are subtopics under Machine Learning (T1). The confidence for these is high (4/5) as they are explicitly mentioned.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other topics. The study doesn't discuss sustainability, digital security, or public health, so those can be ruled out. The focus is on the methods used (Machine Learning) and the subject of study (Behavioral Economics).\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Machine Learning and Behavioral Economics, with the subtopics being unsupervised learning and anomaly detection. The proportions and confidence levels are based on how much each is discussed in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Unsupervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Anomaly Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of machine learning techniques such as unsupervised learning and anomaly detection, which are subtopics under the broader Machine Learning (T1) topic.

The implications are mentioned for online governance, marketing, and community engagement.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The main focus is on pattern recognition and machine learning techniques. The codebook has a topic T1 for Machine Learning, which fits because the abstract uses methods like neural networks (attention mechanisms) and supervised learning (adaptive filtering). \n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). The abstract is purely about the technical aspects of machine learning applied to online discourse.\n\nFor subtopics under Machine Learning, the abstract mentions attention mechanisms, which relate to Neural Networks (a subtopic of T1). It also talks about adaptive filtering, which is part of Supervised Learning. However, the primary subtopic discussed is Neural Networks, as attention mechanisms are a key component in neural network architectures.\n\nSo, the main topic is T1 with a high confidence level.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses digital interactions, focusing on cognitive processes, social structures, and technological infrastructure. It mentions cognitive biases, social norms, and algorithmic determinism. It also talks about implications for digital platform design, online communities, and social media policies.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I consider Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions algorithmic determinism and recommendation algorithms, which are related to machine learning. However, the focus isn't on the algorithms themselves but how they influence interactions. So, T1 is present but not the primary focus.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. The abstract doesn't discuss sustainability, renewable energy, or environmental issues.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is a strong candidate. The abstract discusses cognitive biases, decision-making, and social norms, all of which fall under Behavioral Economics. The study's theoretical framework and findings are centered around these elements, making T8 the primary topic.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is somewhat related because the abstract touches on issues like privacy and security through mentions of cyberbullying and misinformation. However, the focus isn't on security measures or policies but more on the social and cognitive aspects. So, T9 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\nPublic Health (T10) doesn't seem applicable here. There's no discussion of epidemiology, health promotion, or health systems.\n\nFor subtopics, under Behavioral Economics (T8), the abstract clearly discusses Cognitive Biases and Social Norms. These are explicitly mentioned and form the core of the analysis. Algorithmic Determinism and Recommendation Algorithms fall under Machine Learning (T1), but since the focus is more on their impact rather than the algorithms themselves, these are subtopics but with lower confidence.\n\nIn summary, the main topic is Behavioral Economics (T8) with significant portions on Cognitive Biases and Social Norms. Machine Learning (T1) is a secondary topic, with some relevance to Algorithmic Determinism and Recommendation Algorithms. The proportions are estimated based on the focus areas in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Norms\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Algorithmic Determinism\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Recommendation Algorithms\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses cognitive processes and social structures influencing digital interactions, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of predictive analytics to mitigate online risks and improve well-being. It mentions a correlational study using a large dataset, a predictive framework, and supervised training datasets. The results highlight the effectiveness of their model in detecting risks and improving outcomes.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract talks about predictive analytics, which is a part of Machine Learning. It specifically mentions supervised training datasets, which is a subtopic under Machine Learning. So, T1 is definitely present.\n\nNext, considering the context of online risks and safety, Digital Security (T9) seems relevant. The study aims to enhance safety in online environments, which falls under Digital Security. The subtopic here would be predictive analytics, but since that's part of Machine Learning, I need to be careful. However, the focus on safety and risk mitigation aligns more with Digital Security.\n\nPublic Health (T10) might be a stretch. The abstract mentions well-being, which is related, but the primary focus is on online risks and predictive analytics rather than public health interventions or epidemiology. So, I'm less confident about T10.\n\nSustainable Development (T7) and Behavioral Economics (T8) don't seem to fit here. The abstract doesn't discuss environmental issues, resource management, or behavioral decision-making processes.\n\nNow, for subtopics under Machine Learning, the abstract clearly uses supervised learning. It mentions supervised training datasets, which directly points to the subtopic \"Supervised Learning\" under T1.\n\nFor Digital Security, the subtopic would be \"Threat Detection\" since the study is about detecting online risks to enhance safety.\n\nPutting it all together, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1) and Digital Security (T9). The proportions are 60% for T1 and 40% for T9. The subtopics are \"Supervised Learning\" and \"Threat Detection,\" both with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses predictive analytics and supervised learning, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about online interactions, system vulnerabilities, and their impact on public well-being. It mentions combining threat detection, health infrastructure, and machine intelligence. So, right away, I can see that there are a few areas being discussed here.\n\nFirst, the mention of threat detection and system vulnerabilities makes me think of Digital Security. That's one of the topics in the codebook. The abstract also discusses machine intelligence, which falls under Machine Learning. So, I have two main topics here: Digital Security (T9) and Machine Learning (T1).\n\nNow, looking at the subtopics. Under Digital Security, the subtopics include Cybersecurity and Threat Detection. The abstract specifically mentions threat detection, so that's a clear subtopic. For Machine Learning, the subtopics are things like Neural Networks and Supervised Learning. The abstract talks about machine intelligence-based methods, which are a part of Machine Learning, but it doesn't specify a particular subtopic like Supervised Learning. So, I think the subtopic here is just Machine Learning without a more specific subtopic.\n\nNext, I need to estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing threat detection and system vulnerabilities, which are part of Digital Security. Then, it talks about machine intelligence and its application in health infrastructure. So, I'd say Digital Security takes up about 60% of the abstract, and Machine Learning takes up 40%.\n\nFor confidence, I'm pretty sure about Digital Security because threat detection is clearly mentioned. So, confidence is 5. For Machine Learning, it's also clear, but since it's a broader term, I'll give it a confidence of 4.\n\nIn terms of subtopics, Threat Detection is explicitly mentioned, so that's a 5 confidence. For Machine Learning, since it's a topic rather than a subtopic, I don't assign a subtopic confidence here.\n\nI also need to make sure I'm not missing any other topics. The abstract mentions health infrastructure, but that's more of an application area rather than a primary topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the vulnerabilities in interconnected devices in exercise environments, focusing on protecting sensitive information. It mentions a novel approach using computational methodologies, a quasi-experimental design, and advanced pattern recognition techniques. The study's findings highlight the effectiveness of the approach in detecting anomalies and preventing data breaches. It also talks about the implications for secure exercise environments and the development of evidence-based policies.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Digital Security (T9). The abstract talks about vulnerabilities, protecting information, and preventing breaches, which are all within the realm of digital security. The proportion of the abstract related to this topic is quite high, maybe around 70%, as most of the content revolves around security measures and their effectiveness.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions computational methodologies and pattern recognition techniques. These fall under Machine Learning (T1). The quasi-experimental design and the use of advanced techniques suggest that machine learning is a significant part of the study. I'd estimate about 30% of the abstract is related to this topic.\n\nNow, for subtopics. Under Digital Security (T9), the abstract discusses vulnerabilities and the protection of information, which aligns with the subtopic \"Cybersecurity.\" The confidence here is high because the focus is on securing data in exercise environments.\n\nUnder Machine Learning (T1), the use of pattern recognition techniques points to \"Supervised Learning\" as a subtopic. The study's approach involves detecting anomalies, which is a common application of supervised learning methods. The confidence here is also high because the techniques mentioned are typical in supervised learning contexts.\n\nI don't see any mention of topics like Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, or Public Health in the abstract, so those can be ruled out.\n\nTo summarize, the abstract primarily deals with Digital Security and Machine Learning, with subtopics in Cybersecurity and Supervised Learning. The proportions and confidence levels reflect the emphasis on each area within the study.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses vulnerabilities in exercise environments and the use of computational methodologies to mitigate risks, which falls under Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of AI-driven predictive models in physical training and rehabilitation. It mentions the development of a framework that uses adaptive risk prediction and automated feedback mechanisms. The study involved a quasi-experimental design with two groups, one using AI interventions and the other following traditional methods. The results show significant improvements in injury reduction and adherence, with high accuracy in the AI models.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topic here is clearly Machine Learning (T1) because the study uses AI-driven models, which fall under this category. The subtopics within Machine Learning that are relevant include Supervised Learning and Predictive Models, though the abstract doesn't explicitly mention supervised learning. However, the use of predictive models is a key aspect, so that's a subtopic.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is purely on the application of AI in exercise science, which ties back to Machine Learning.\n\nFor the proportion, the entire abstract is centered around the AI framework, so Machine Learning accounts for 100% of the content. The confidence is high since the abstract explicitly discusses AI and predictive models.\n\nIn terms of subtopics, Predictive Models is the most relevant, with a high confidence level. There's no mention of other subtopics like Neural Networks or Reinforcement Learning, so they aren't applicable here.\n\nSo, the final analysis should list Machine Learning as the only topic with 100% proportion and confidence 5. The subtopic is Predictive Models with confidence 4, as it's a key part but not explicitly named in the codebook's subtopics, though it's implied under Supervised Learning.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of AI-driven predictive models, which fall under the broader topic of Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the transition to environmentally conscious practices, focusing on clean energy alternatives and their impact on reducing environmentally mediated disease burdens. It specifically looks at the role of advertisement campaigns in promoting clean energy adoption. The study uses a survey of stakeholders from the advertisement and energy sectors, highlighting the effectiveness of targeted ads in increasing solar and wind energy uptake. It also shows correlations between clean energy adoption and reductions in health issues like respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. The implications emphasize collaboration between policymakers and industry stakeholders to develop effective campaigns.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the abstract's content to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for TOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract heavily discusses clean energy, resource management (through advertisement campaigns), and the transition to a low-carbon economy. These are all within the realm of sustainable development. The proportion of the abstract dealing with this is significant, around 60%.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: The study examines how clean energy adoption reduces health risks, specifically looking at disease incidence and mortality.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on solar-powered advertising campaigns and their impact on promoting environmentally conscious behaviors. It mentions a mixed-methods approach, including surveys and interviews, and talks about environmental awareness, sustainable behaviors, and implications for policymakers and advertisers.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any algorithms, models, or techniques related to ML. So, T1 is not present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The study is about promoting environmental awareness and sustainable behaviors, which directly relates to Sustainable Development. The abstract discusses renewable energy (solar-powered ads) and environmental impact, which are subtopics under T7. This seems to be the main focus.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) deals with how psychological factors influence economic decisions. While the study looks at behaviors, it doesn't delve into economic decision-making or cognitive biases, so T8 isn't applicable.\n\nDigital Security (T9) involves cybersecurity and privacy, which aren't mentioned here. Public Health (T10) focuses on health at the population level, but the study is more about environmental behavior than health outcomes, so T10 isn't relevant.\n\nTherefore, the only topic present is Sustainable Development (T7). The entire abstract is dedicated to this topic, so the proportion is 100%. My confidence is high, so I'll rate it 5.\n\nFor subtopics under T7, the abstract mentions renewable energy (solar-powered ads) and environmental monitoring (impact on environmental awareness). These are both subtopics in the codebook. I'm confident about renewable energy, so I'll rate that 5. Environmental monitoring is a bit of a stretch since the study is about the impact of ads, not direct environmental monitoring, so I'll rate that 4.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not misclassifying. The study doesn't discuss other subtopics like climate change mitigation or resource management in detail, so those aren't applicable. The focus is on the effectiveness of the campaigns, which ties into renewable energy and, to some extent, environmental monitoring.\n\nSo, the final identification is T7 with two subtopics: Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the impact of solar-powered advertising campaigns on environmental awareness and sustainable behaviors, which falls under Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the correlation between eco-friendly practices and cyber risk management in childcare facilities. It mentions environmental sustainability indicators (ESI) and cyber threat detection capabilities (CTDC). The study found a positive correlation between these two factors, with specific examples like password management, software updates, employee training, and energy-efficient lighting systems.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the topic of Sustainable Development (T7) seems relevant because the abstract talks about eco-friendly practices, environmental sustainability, and resource management. The study's focus on reducing environmental footprint aligns with T7's subtopics like Renewable Energy and Resource Management.\n\nNext, Digital Security (T9) is present because the abstract discusses cyber risk management, password management, software updates, and threat detection. These are all subtopics under T9, specifically Cybersecurity and Threat Detection.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is solely on the intersection of environmental sustainability and cyber security in childcare facilities.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of each topic. The abstract spends about 60% discussing Sustainable Development, as it covers eco-friendly practices, their impact, and policy implications. The remaining 40% is about Digital Security, detailing cyber risk management strategies and their correlation with environmental practices.\n\nFor subtopics, under T7, the relevant ones are Renewable Energy (though not explicitly mentioned, energy-efficient lighting is a form of renewable energy practice) and Resource Management (as it deals with reducing energy consumption). Under T9, Cybersecurity and Threat Detection are clearly discussed, with examples like password management and software updates.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly mentions terms like environmental sustainability, cyber threat detection, and specific practices related to both areas. There's no ambiguity in linking these to the codebook's topics and subtopics.\n\nSo, the final analysis should list T7 and T9 as the main topics with their respective proportions and confidence levels, and the subtopics Renewable Energy, Resource Management, Cybersecurity, and Threat Detection with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the intersection of environmental sustainability and cyber risk management in childcare facilities.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the intersection of environmental sustainability and cybersecurity in the context of childcare facilities. It mentions mitigating climate change impacts and detecting cyber threats. The study uses a correlational approach to examine relationships between facility characteristics, climate risk management, and cyber threat prevention. The findings show that integrating these strategies reduces cyber incidents and improves staff engagement and satisfaction.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for topics:\n- The abstract talks about environmental sustainability, which falls under Sustainable Development (T7). It also discusses cybersecurity, which is part of Digital Security (T9). There's no mention of Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Public Health, so those aren't relevant here.\n\nNext, estimating the proportion each topic takes:\n- Sustainable Development (T7) seems to cover about 60% of the abstract, as it discusses climate change, risk management, and sustainability in childcare.\n- Digital Security (T9) covers about 40%, focusing on cybersecurity measures and threat prevention.\n\nFor subtopics:\n- Under T7, the abstract mentions climate-focused risk management strategies, which is a subtopic of Sustainable Development.\n- Under T9, it discusses cyber threat prevention measures, which is a subtopic of Digital Security.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly mentions both areas and their specific strategies. There's no overlap or ambiguity in the terminology used, so my confidence is high for each identification.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Climate Change Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the intersection of environmental sustainability (T7) and cybersecurity (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that looks into how eco-friendly practices and wellness programs in educational institutions can help mitigate preventable illnesses and promote sustainability. It mentions a survey conducted among students, teachers, and administrators, focusing on their attitudes towards energy conservation, waste management, and healthy lifestyles. The findings highlight the correlation between environmental practices and human well-being, suggesting a need for a multi-faceted approach involving education, wellness, and environmental stewardship.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics fit this abstract.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7). The study is about environmental conservation, resource management, and promoting sustainability, which are all under T7. The abstract also talks about human well-being, which ties into the social equity aspect of sustainable development.\n\nNext, the subtopics. The study mentions \"Renewable Energy\" and \"Environmental Monitoring\" as part of the survey questions, but more prominently, it discusses \"Resource Management\" and \"Sustainable Cities.\" However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention \"Renewable Energy\" or \"Environmental Monitoring,\" so I'm less confident about those. The focus is more on how institutions can manage resources and create sustainable environments, which points to \"Resource Management\" and \"Sustainable Cities.\"\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The study is more about environmental and social aspects within education, so those topics don't apply here.\n\nFor the proportions, since the entire study is centered around Sustainable Development, it's 100%. There are no other topics mentioned, so no need to split the proportion.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm very confident about T7 being the main topic, so a confidence rating of 5. For the subtopics, \"Resource Management\" and \"Sustainable Cities\" are clearly relevant, so I'll rate them at 4 each because they are mentioned but not in as much detail as the overall topic.\n\nI think that's all. The abstract doesn't touch on any other topics or subtopics from the codebook, so I won't include them.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses environmental conservation, resource management, and sustainable practices within educational institutions, aligning with the Sustainable Development (T7) topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to approach this problem. The user has provided an abstract and wants me to analyze it using a predefined codebook. My task is to identify the relevant topics and subtopics, estimate their proportions, and provide confidence ratings. \n\nFirst, I'll read through the abstract carefully. It talks about environmental sustainability, community health, and educational outcomes. The study uses a survey and mixed-methods analysis, focusing on renewable energy, health promotion, and their impact on schools.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics. The main areas discussed are environmental sustainability and health promotion. Environmental sustainability falls under Sustainable Development (T7), specifically Renewable Energy and Environmental Monitoring. Health promotion relates to Public Health (T10), particularly Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.\n\nI should also consider if any other topics like Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Digital Security are mentioned. The abstract doesn't discuss any machine learning techniques, behavioral economic theories, or digital security issues, so those can be ruled out.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The majority of the content is about environmental sustainability and its impact on health, which seems to take up about 60%. The remaining 40% discusses health promotion and its relation to educational outcomes.\n\nFor subtopics, Renewable Energy is clearly mentioned, as well as Environmental Monitoring through the discussion of greenhouse gas emissions. Health Promotion is directly addressed, and Disease Prevention is implied through the reduction of health issues.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly mentions renewable energy, health promotion, and their effects on the community. There's no ambiguity here, so my confidence ratings are high.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response, making sure to include all the required elements: topics with their proportions and confidence, subtopics with confidence, and a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.6,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.4,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses environmental sustainability and community health, which fall under Sustainable Development (T7) and Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses the role of eco-friendly advertising strategies in mitigating environmental harm. It mentions specific strategies like greenwashing, eco-labeling, and sustainable product placement. The study uses a quasi-experimental design with mixed methods, including surveys, focus groups, and content analysis. The findings highlight the effectiveness of certain strategies and their impact on consumer behavior, suggesting implications for advertisers and policymakers.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content of the abstract to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for TOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\n1. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The abstract focuses on environmental sustainability, eco-friendly practices, and reducing carbon footprints. These are directly related to sustainable development. The majority of the abstract discusses strategies and their impact on the environment, so this topic is prominent.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: While the abstract doesn't explicitly mention public health, it does discuss consumer behavior and the impact of advertising on behavior related to recycling and energy conservation. These aspects can be tangentially related to public health, but it's a minor connection.\n\n3. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The study touches on consumer behavior and decision-making, which falls under behavioral economics. However, the focus is more on the environmental impact of advertising rather than the economic decisions themselves, so this is a secondary topic.\n\n4. **Machine Learning (T1)** and **Digital Security (T9)**: These topics don't seem relevant to the abstract as there's no mention of algorithms, data models, cybersecurity, or privacy issues.\n\nSo, the main topic is Sustainable Development (T7) with a high proportion of the abstract. Public Health (T10) and Behavioral Economics (T8) are present but to a lesser extent.\n\nNext, for SUBTOPIC IDENTIFICATION:\n\nLooking at the subtopics under each identified topic:\n\n- Under T7 (Sustainable Development), the subtopics include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. The abstract discusses eco-friendly advertising and its impact on reducing carbon footprints, which relates to Environmental Monitoring and possibly Resource Management.\n\n- Under T10 (Public Health), subtopics like Epidemiology, Health Promotion, Disease Prevention, Health Equity, and Health Systems are listed. The abstract's connection to public health is through consumer behavior, which might relate to Health Promotion, but it's a stretch.\n\n- Under T8 (Behavioral Economics), subtopics include Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, and Intertemporal Choice. The study examines consumer behavior and decision-making influenced by advertising, which aligns with Decision Making and possibly Cognitive Biases.\n\nHowever, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention subtopics like Cognitive Biases or Risk Assessment. It mainly discusses the effectiveness of advertising strategies and their impact on consumer behavior, which could be linked to Decision Making under Behavioral Economics.\n\nPutting it all together, the primary topic is Sustainable Development (T7) with a significant portion of the abstract. Public Health (T10) and Behavioral Economics (T8) are present but to a lesser extent. The subtopics identified are Environmental Monitoring and Decision Making, but the confidence is moderate as the connections are not explicit.\n\nI need to structure this into the required JSON format, ensuring that the topics and subtopics are correctly identified with their respective proportions and confidence levels. I'll also provide a brief explanation of how the topics and subtopics were distinguished.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The primary focus on environmental strategies and their impact aligns with Sustainable Development (T7).

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The abstract talks about advertising's effect on consumer behavior and environmental attitudes. That sounds like Behavioral Economics because it's about how people make decisions, especially regarding environmental issues. I'm pretty confident about that, so I'll give it a 5.\n\nNext, looking at the subtopics under Behavioral Economics, the abstract mentions consumer behavior and attitudes. That fits under Decision Making, which is a subtopic. I'm pretty sure about this too, so confidence is 4.\n\nNow, checking the other topics in the codebook. There's nothing about Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health here. The focus is purely on behavior and decision-making, so those other topics don't apply.\n\nI should also consider if any other subtopics might fit, but the main points are about how people decide and act, so Decision Making is the best fit. No other subtopics from the codebook seem relevant here.\n\nSo, to sum up, the main topic is Behavioral Economics with a high confidence, and the subtopic is Decision Making. I don't see any other topics or subtopics mentioned in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the impact of environmentally focused advertising on consumer behavior and attitudes, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this abstract using the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about a correlational study looking at the relationships between environmental stewardship and innovative identity verification strategies in advertising. It mentions things like biometric authentication, cryptographic techniques, facial recognition, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proof protocols. It also discusses the impact on carbon emissions and resource waste, and how these strategies can promote sustainability.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics and subtopics are present.\n\nFirst, the main topics. The abstract discusses environmental stewardship and innovative identity verification. Environmental stewardship falls under Sustainable Development (T7). The identity verification strategies involve technologies like biometrics and blockchain, which are part of Digital Security (T9). There's also a mention of how these strategies affect advertising practices, which could relate to Public Health (T10) in terms of health equity and systems, but I'm not sure if that's a strong fit.\n\nSo, I think the main topics are T7 and T9. T7 is about sustainable development, and T9 is about digital security. The abstract spends a good portion discussing how these technologies reduce environmental impact, so T7 might take up about 60%, and T9 about 40%. I'm pretty confident about T7 and T9, maybe a confidence of 4 each.\n\nFor subtopics, under T7, the abstract talks about reducing carbon emissions and resource management, which fits under Resource Management. Under T9, the subtopics mentioned are cryptographic techniques, biometric authentication, blockchain, and zero-knowledge proofs. These correspond to Cybersecurity and Privacy Enhancing Technologies in T9's subtopics. So, the subtopics are Resource Management, Cybersecurity, and Privacy Enhancing Technologies. I'm confident about these, so maybe a 4 for each.\n\nI don't think Machine Learning (T1) or Behavioral Economics (T8) are present here. The abstract doesn't mention any learning algorithms or behavioral economic theories. Public Health (T10) is a bit of a stretch since the focus is more on environmental and security aspects rather than health systems or equity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the topics are T7 and T9, with their respective proportions and confidence. The subtopics are Resource Management, Cybersecurity, and Privacy Enhancing Technologies, each with a confidence of 4.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of advanced identity verification methods (Digital Security) with environmental conservation efforts (Sustainable Development).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about how digital platforms have changed advertising. The main points seem to be about identity verification, resource allocation, and advertising efficacy. \n\nFirst, I need to figure out which topics from the codebook are present. The abstract talks about identity verification and resource allocation, which sounds like it's related to Digital Security (T9) because it mentions things like multi-factor authentication. Also, the part about resource management and sustainability might tie into Sustainable Development (T7). \n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportions. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing identity verification and authentication methods, so maybe 40% on Digital Security. The resource allocation and sustainability part is also significant, so 35% on Sustainable Development. The rest, about 25%, seems to be more general or not fitting into the predefined topics.\n\nFor confidence, I'm pretty sure about Digital Security because of the specific terms like multi-factor authentication. Sustainable Development is a bit less direct, but the mention of resource management and sustainability gives me moderate confidence.\n\nNow, looking at subtopics. Under Digital Security (T9), the abstract specifically mentions multi-factor authentication, which is a subtopic. For Sustainable Development (T7), resource management is discussed, which is another subtopic. \n\nI think I've covered all the relevant parts. The abstract doesn't mention anything about Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Public Health, so those aren't applicable here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses identity verification and resource allocation in advertising, which relates to Digital Security (T9) and Sustainable Development (T7).

The study uses a quasi-experimental design, analyzing data from 500 advertisements over three decades. Key findings include the effectiveness of emotional and social messaging, vivid imagery, and narratives in influencing behavior. The abstract also mentions a historical shift in the focus of climate-related ads towards individual agency and collective responsibility.\n\nNow, I'll refer to the codebook to see which topics and subtopics are relevant.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nThe abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, cybersecurity issues, or public health policies. However, it does focus on climate change and the impact of messaging on behavior, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7) and Behavioral Economics (T8).\n\nFor Sustainable Development (T7), the subtopics include Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. The abstract discusses climate change mitigation through advertisements, so that's a relevant subtopic.\n\nFor Behavioral Economics (T8), the subtopics are Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, and Intertemporal Choice. The study looks at how messaging affects decision-making and behavior, which ties into Decision Making and Social Preferences.\n\nI'll estimate the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends more time discussing the impact of advertisements on behavior and public perception, which is more aligned with Behavioral Economics. However, the context is about climate change, which is part of Sustainable Development. I'll allocate 60% to Behavioral Economics and 40% to Sustainable Development.\n\nConfidence levels: I'm very confident about Behavioral Economics (T8) because the study focuses on behavior change. I'm also confident about Sustainable Development (T7) as it deals with climate issues, but it's a bit less central.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract clearly discusses Decision Making and Social Preferences, so I'll rate those highly. Climate Change Mitigation is mentioned but less prominently, so a lower confidence there.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Social Preferences\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Climate Change Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the impact of advertisements on environmental consciousness and behavior, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8) as it examines decision-making and social preferences.

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of targeted advertising to influence consumer behavior towards more eco-friendly choices. It mentions a quasi-experimental design, the impact of advertisements on purchasing decisions, and factors influencing the effectiveness of these strategies. The study's findings highlight increased consumer awareness, the role of emotional appeals, and the influence of social norms. It also touches on implications for businesses, policymakers, and environmental advocates.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7) because the study is about reducing carbon footprints and promoting eco-friendly products, which are related to environmental sustainability. The abstract extensively discusses strategies to mitigate environmental impact, which is a core aspect of Sustainable Development.\n\nNext, the study involves understanding consumer behavior and decision-making, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). The research examines how advertising influences purchasing decisions, which is a behavioral aspect. The subtopics here could be Decision Making and Cognitive Biases, as the study looks into how consumers make choices based on advertisements.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on advertising strategies and their impact on consumer behavior, not on technological methods, security issues, or public health policies.\n\nFor subtopics under T7, the abstract discusses strategies like targeted advertising and emotional appeals, which relate to Communication Strategies and Consumer Behavior. However, looking at the codebook, the subtopics under Sustainable Development are Renewable Energy, Climate Change Mitigation, Resource Management, Environmental Monitoring, and Sustainable Cities. None of these directly match the content of the abstract, which is more about consumer behavior and advertising strategies. Therefore, there might not be a direct subtopic under T7 in this case.\n\nWait, perhaps I should reconsider. The study is about influencing consumer behavior to promote sustainable practices, which is part of Sustainable Development. The subtopics under T7 are more about environmental aspects, but the study's focus is on the behavioral and advertising strategies. So maybe the subtopics aren't directly applicable here, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, the subtopics under Behavioral Economics (T8) include Decision Making and Cognitive Biases, which are relevant since the study looks into how consumers make decisions based on advertisements. So, under T8, the subtopics Decision Making and Cognitive Biases would be applicable.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Topic T7 (Sustainable Development) is present because the study aims to mitigate environmental impact through consumer behavior changes.\n- Topic T8 (Behavioral Economics) is present because it examines how advertising influences consumer decisions, which is a behavioral economic aspect.\n\nThe proportion for T7 would be higher since the study is primarily about sustainable practices and environmental impact. T8 is also significant but perhaps a bit less than T7.\n\nSubtopics would include Decision Making and Cognitive Biases under T8, as the study discusses how consumers make choices influenced by advertisements, which can involve biases and decision-making processes.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics and subtopics. The main topics are the broader areas, while subtopics are the finer aspects within those topics.\n\nSo, the final identification would be:\n\n- Topics: T7 (Sustainable Development) and T8 (Behavioral Economics)\n- Subtopics: Decision Making and Cognitive Biases under T8\n\nI should also rate the confidence for each topic and subtopic based on how clearly they are addressed in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses strategies to mitigate environmental impact through consumer behavior changes, aligning with Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the prevalence of chronic diseases in marginalized communities and how unequal access to physical activity opportunities contributes to this issue. It mentions a study using a correlational design with a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from the American Community Survey and qualitative insights from focus groups and interviews. The findings highlight the correlation between socioeconomic factors and access to physical activity, as well as systemic barriers like transportation and safety. The study proposes interventions involving community-based initiatives, policy reforms, and healthcare training to promote health equity.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify which topics are present. The main areas discussed are health disparities, chronic diseases, access to physical activity, and policy interventions. These all fall under the umbrella of Public Health, specifically under the topic T10. The abstract doesn't mention any methodologies from other topics like Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, or Digital Security. Therefore, T10 is the only topic present.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion of the abstract related to T10. The entire abstract is focused on public health issues, so I'll allocate 100% to T10 with a high confidence level of 5.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract discusses health equity, which is a subtopic under T10. The study's focus on reducing disparities and promoting equity directly relates to health equity. There's no mention of other subtopics like epidemiology or health systems, so only health equity is relevant here. I'll rate the confidence for this subtopic as 5.\n\nIn summary, the abstract is entirely within the domain of Public Health, specifically addressing health equity through a mixed-methods study on access to physical activity and systemic barriers. No other topics or subtopics from the codebook are applicable here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on health disparities and access to physical activity in underserved communities, which falls under Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses inequitable access to physical activity opportunities and its implications for population health. It mentions socioeconomic status, urban planning, and access to physical activity. The study uses correlational analysis, survey data, and spatial mapping techniques. The findings highlight the impact of socioeconomic status and urban planning on access to physical activity opportunities, with recommendations for policymakers and urban planners.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Public Health (T10). The abstract focuses on population health outcomes, access to physical activity, and implications for health equity. The methods used, like survey data and correlational analysis, are common in public health research. The discussion of health equity and policy implications also aligns with T10's subtopics, particularly Health Equity and Health Systems.\n\nNext, I consider if any other topics are present. The study touches on urban planning and spatial mapping, which might relate to Sustainable Development (T7), especially subtopics like Resource Management or Environmental Monitoring. However, the primary focus is on health outcomes and equity, making Public Health the dominant topic.\n\nFor subtopics under T10, the abstract explicitly mentions Health Equity and Health Systems. The study examines disparities in access to physical activity, which ties into Health Equity. The discussion of policy and urban planning strategies relates to Health Systems, as it involves interventions and policy development.\n\nI don't see evidence of other topics like Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Digital Security being discussed. The methods used are statistical and spatial analysis, which are more aligned with public health methodologies rather than other fields.\n\nIn terms of proportions, the majority of the abstract is dedicated to Public Health, so I'll allocate 80% to T10. The remaining 20% touches on aspects that could relate to Sustainable Development, but since it's secondary, I'll note it as a possible consideration but not assign a high proportion.\n\nConfidence levels are high for T10 (4/5) because the content clearly aligns with public health themes. For the subtopics, Health Equity and Health Systems are directly addressed, so confidence is 4/5 each.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping into other topics. The mention of urban planning doesn't shift the focus away from public health; it's a factor within the public health context. Therefore, T7 isn't the primary focus here.\n\nIn summary, the abstract is centered around Public Health, with subtopics in Health Equity and Health Systems. Other areas mentioned support the main topic but don't constitute separate primary topics.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Systems\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses issues related to health equity and health systems, which fall under the Public Health (T10) topic.

Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about urban challenges, technology-enabled governance, and mentions fields like urban studies, information systems, and community development. It also discusses data-driven decision-making and participatory planning. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The codebook has topics like Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nLooking at the abstract, it doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, so T1 is out. It does talk about sustainable development aspects like environmental sustainability and resource management, so T7 seems relevant. There's a focus on governance and community engagement, which could relate to Behavioral Economics (T8) since it involves decision-making and social factors. Public Health (T10) isn't directly addressed here, so I'll exclude that. \n\nNow, estimating proportions. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing sustainable development, maybe 40%, and about 30% on behavioral economics. The remaining 30% covers other areas not in the codebook.\n\nFor subtopics, under T7, the abstract mentions environmental sustainability and resource management. Under T8, it touches on decision-making and community engagement, which are subtopics. \n\nI'm confident about T7 and T8, so I'll rate them a 4 each. The subtopics are clearly mentioned, so I'll give them a 4 as well. \n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up topics and subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while subtopics are the specific areas within them. The abstract doesn't mention any digital security or public health aspects, so those are out.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with T7 and T8 as topics, their proportions, and the relevant subtopics.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the intersection of epidemiology, cybersecurity, and urban planning. It talks about mitigating infectious outbreaks in high-density sports settings. It mentions developing an integrated framework, using a mixed-methods approach, and examining factors like contact tracing, data-driven decision-making, and infrastructure design. The findings suggest real-time monitoring systems, data-driven protocols, green spaces, and natural ventilation. It also highlights implications for policymakers and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to map these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for TOPICS:\n\n1. **Public Health (T10)**: The abstract heavily discusses epidemiology, disease prevention, and health systems. It talks about infectious diseases, outbreaks, and strategies to prevent them. The framework developed is aimed at public health outcomes, so this is a major topic.\n\n2. **Digital Security (T9)**: The abstract mentions cybersecurity, specifically in the context of data-driven decision-making, real-time monitoring systems, and threat detection. These elements fall under digital security.\n\n3. **Sustainable Development (T7)**: The study touches on urban planning and infrastructure design, particularly green spaces and natural ventilation. These are aspects of sustainable development, focusing on environmental and resource management.\n\nNext, for SUBTOPICS:\n\n- **Epidemiology (T10.1)**: Directly mentioned as a key area, so this is a subtopic.\n- **Cybersecurity (T9.1)**: Discussed in terms of data-driven systems and monitoring, so this is relevant.\n- **Resource Management (T7.3)**: The mention of green spaces and ventilation relates to managing resources sustainably.\n- **Health Promotion (T10.2)**: The study aims to promote health through various strategies, so this is applicable.\n\nI need to ensure that each identified topic and subtopic is supported by explicit content in the abstract. The proportions for topics are estimated based on the focus: Public Health is the most discussed, followed by Digital Security, and then Sustainable Development. Subtopics are identified where specific elements align with the codebook definitions.\n\nI should also consider confidence levels. Public Health is clearly central, so high confidence. Digital Security is mentioned but not as extensively, so medium confidence. Sustainable Development is present but less emphasized, so medium confidence. For subtopics, each has clear evidence, so high confidence.\n\nFinally, I need to structure the JSON output with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the subtopics with their confidence. The disambiguation explanation should clarify how topics and subtopics were distinguished based on the abstract's content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Epidemiology\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of epidemiology (T10.1), cybersecurity (T9.1), and urban planning aspects like resource management (T7.3).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about safeguarding in educational institutions and developing an intelligent adaptive system. It mentions threat mitigation, intelligent systems, and social determinants of wellbeing. They used advanced algorithms and analyzed datasets to detect and respond to threats. The results show a reduction in data breaches and cyber-attacks, and improvements in social determinants like access to resources.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The codebook has five topics: Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nLooking at the abstract, the system uses advanced algorithms, which is a key part of Machine Learning. So, T1 is definitely present. The focus on threat detection and cybersecurity points to Digital Security (T9). The mention of social determinants of wellbeing and their improvement relates to Public Health (T10), specifically Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing the intelligent system and its threat detection, which is about 40%. The social determinants part is about 30%, and the rest is about the overall framework and applications, which might fall under other areas not in the codebook, so I'll ignore those for now.\n\nFor confidence, I'm pretty sure about T1 and T9, so I'll give them a 5. T10 is a bit less direct, so maybe a 4.\n\nNext, the subtopics. Under T1, the system uses advanced algorithms, which is a part of Machine Learning. So, the subtopic here is \"Advanced Algorithms\" but looking at the codebook, the subtopics under T1 are Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. Wait, the codebook doesn't list \"Advanced Algorithms\" as a subtopic. Hmm, maybe I should look again. The abstract mentions \"advanced algorithms,\" which is a part of Machine Learning, but the codebook's subtopics under T1 don't include that. So perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly listed, but the main topic is clear.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The codebook's subtopics under T1 are specific types of learning, but the abstract uses algorithms in a broader sense. So maybe the subtopic isn't directly applicable, but the main topic is definitely Machine Learning.\n\nFor Digital Security (T9), the subtopics include Cybersecurity, which is clearly mentioned in the abstract. So, the subtopic here is Cybersecurity with high confidence.\n\nUnder Public Health (T10), the subtopics are things like Epidemiology, Health Promotion, etc. The abstract talks about social determinants of wellbeing, which relates to Health Promotion and maybe Health Equity. So, the subtopic here is Health Promotion with moderate confidence.\n\nPutting it all together, the main topics are T1, T9, and T10 with proportions 40%, 30%, and 30% respectively. The subtopics are Cybersecurity under T9 and Health Promotion under T10.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the development of an intelligent adaptive system using advanced algorithms, which falls under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses integrating contextual predictive modeling with secure data management in educational institutions. It mentions using reinforcement-based algorithms and machine learning techniques. The research focuses on the intersection of cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, and public health, with an emphasis on promoting health equity.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll identify the topics. The abstract heavily discusses machine learning techniques like predictive modeling and reinforcement learning, which clearly falls under T1. It also talks about cybersecurity, which is part of Digital Security (T9). Additionally, the focus on public health and health equity points to T10.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The abstract spends a significant portion discussing machine learning, so I'll allocate 40%. Cybersecurity is another major area, so 35%. Public health, while important, is discussed in the context of the other two, so 25%.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract uses reinforcement-based algorithms, which is a subtopic of Reinforcement Learning. Under Digital Security (T9), the focus is on cybersecurity. The Public Health (T10) aspect is about health equity.\n\nI'm confident about these identifications, so I'll rate each with a 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cybersecurity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses machine learning techniques (T1) such as reinforcement-based algorithms and predictive modeling.

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of eco-friendly practices and robust authentication systems in childcare settings. It mentions adopting renewable energy, sustainable waste management, and energy-efficient infrastructure. These points clearly relate to Sustainable Development, specifically the subtopics of Renewable Energy and Resource Management.\n\nAdditionally, the study talks about advanced authentication technologies like biometric systems, facial recognition, and blockchain-based encryption. These fall under Digital Security, particularly the subtopics of Authentication Methods and Threat Detection.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, Sustainable Development (T7) and Digital Security (T9) are the main topics. The abstract doesn't mention Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, or Public Health, so those can be excluded.\n\nFor proportions, the abstract spends about 60% discussing Sustainable Development, covering eco-friendly practices and their impact. The remaining 40% is dedicated to Digital Security, detailing authentication technologies and their benefits.\n\nRegarding confidence, I'm very confident about Sustainable Development (rating 5) and highly confident about Digital Security (rating 4). The subtopics Renewable Energy, Resource Management, Authentication Methods, and Threat Detection are clearly mentioned, so their confidence ratings are 5 each.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not missing any other possible topics. The abstract doesn't touch on methodologies like supervised learning or behavioral economics, so sticking with T7 and T9 is accurate.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the relevant subtopics with their confidence ratings.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses integrating ecological principles into caregiving practices in childcare settings. It mentions the impact on environmental outcomes and children's development. The methods include a mixed-methods approach with observational research. The findings show reductions in energy consumption and waste, as well as improvements in cognitive and social skills among children.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract talks about ecological principles, environmental degradation, and sustainable practices in caregiving. These are directly related to Sustainable Development, specifically the subtopics of Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities. The study's focus on reducing environmental impact and promoting eco-friendly behaviors aligns with T7.\n\nNext, considering Public Health (T10), the abstract mentions the impact on children's cognitive and social development, which relates to health promotion and child well-being. However, the primary focus is on environmental aspects rather than public health methodologies or policies. So, T10 is present but to a lesser extent.\n\nOther topics like Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, and Digital Security don't seem relevant here. The methods used are mixed-methods, but they don't tie into any specific subtopics of the listed topics.\n\nFor subtopics under T7, the abstract discusses environmental monitoring through reduced energy consumption and waste, which points to Environmental Monitoring. The integration of ecological principles into caregiving practices in childcare settings relates to Sustainable Cities, as it's about creating sustainable environments in urban settings.\n\nIn summary, the main topic is Sustainable Development (T7) with a significant portion of the abstract, followed by a minor mention of Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses human judgment in competitive environments, specifically looking at cognitive biases like recency bias. It mentions an experimental study with participants recognizing patterns in a sports scenario. They used pattern recognition algorithms to mitigate these biases. The implications are discussed across various fields like finance, healthcare, and education.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the main topics and subtopics. The study is about how cognitive biases affect decision-making, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract doesn't mention any Machine Learning (T1) methods beyond the algorithms used, which are more about pattern recognition, not a primary focus. Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10) don't seem relevant here.\n\nFor subtopics under Behavioral Economics, the abstract talks about cognitive biases and decision-making, so the subtopics would be \"Cognitive Biases\" and \"Decision Making.\"\n\nI'll estimate the proportions: most of the abstract is about Behavioral Economics, so around 70%, with the rest being other areas not covered in the codebook. Confidence is high for T8, moderate for the subtopics since they're clearly mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses cognitive biases and decision-making processes, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the integration of predictive analytics and decision theory in athlete selection. It mentions the use of a hybrid approach combining decision theory with machine-based models. They developed a predictive model using athlete performance metrics and tested it against existing strategies. The study also highlights the importance of contextual factors and transfer learning techniques.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for topics:\n- The abstract heavily uses predictive analytics and machine-based models, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). The discussion of transfer learning and model development supports this.\n- The study also involves decision theory, which is part of Behavioral Economics (T8), as it deals with human decision-making processes.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions:\n- Machine Learning seems to be the primary focus, especially with the predictive model and transfer learning. I'd estimate around 60%.\n- Behavioral Economics, while significant, is secondary, so about 40%.\n\nFor subtopics:\n- Transfer Learning is explicitly mentioned under Machine Learning, so that's a subtopic.\n- Decision Making is part of Behavioral Economics and is discussed in the context of team managers' strategies.\n\nI don't see any elements related to the other topics like Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). The focus is clearly on the integration of machine learning and decision theory.\n\nSo, the identified topics are T1 and T8, with their respective proportions and confidence levels.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses using online social platforms as data sources to monitor and mitigate environmental impacts. It mentions applying data analysis techniques, a quasi-experimental design, and advanced data modeling. The focus is on how social media can inform environmental policy and practice, particularly looking at visual content and urban vs. rural discussions.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract talks about data analysis techniques and data modeling, which are part of Machine Learning. However, it doesn't specify any subtopics like Neural Networks or Supervised Learning. So, T1 is present but not in depth.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) seems highly relevant. The study is about environmental impact, using social media data for eco-friendly futures, and policy-making. This aligns with Sustainable Development's focus on environmental protection and resource management. The abstract also mentions environmental monitoring and sustainable cities indirectly through urban-rural comparisons. So, T7 is a major topic here.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) could be a fit since the study looks at public perceptions and behaviors. However, the abstract doesn't delve into decision-making, cognitive biases, or other subtopics. It's more about data analysis than behavioral aspects, so T8 might not be the primary focus.\n\nDigital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) don't seem relevant here. The abstract doesn't mention cybersecurity, privacy, health policies, or epidemiology.\n\nNow, estimating proportions: Sustainable Development (T7) takes up about 70% as it's the main focus. Machine Learning (T1) is about 30% since it's used as a tool but not the primary subject.\n\nFor subtopics under T7, the abstract mentions environmental monitoring (through social media data) and sustainable cities (urban vs. rural). These are both subtopics of Sustainable Development. There's no mention of renewable energy or climate change mitigation, so those aren't applicable.\n\nSo, the identified topics are T7 (70%) and T1 (30%). The subtopics are Environmental Monitoring and Sustainable Cities, each with high confidence since they're clearly discussed.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the use of social media data for environmental monitoring and sustainable development, aligning with T7.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze this abstract using the provided codebook. Let's start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about using social media data for environmental monitoring. They mention developing a framework that uses artificial intelligence, specifically a neural network with transfer learning. They also discuss the results, showing improved accuracy in detecting environmental anomalies. Additionally, they touch on the correlation between social media posts and environmental awareness, and the importance of contextual information like location and time.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Machine Learning (T1) because they're using neural networks and transfer learning, which are subtopics under T1. The abstract spends a good portion discussing the AI framework and its application, so I'd estimate around 60% of the abstract is about Machine Learning. My confidence here is high, so I'll rate it a 5.\n\nNext, the study is about environmental monitoring, which falls under Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract discusses how this AI framework helps in environmental monitoring and mentions its implications for sustainability. This seems to take up about 40% of the abstract. I'm pretty confident about this, so I'll give it a 4.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning, they specifically mention neural networks and transfer learning. These are clearly subtopics from T1. I'm very confident about these, so each gets a 5.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from other topics mentioned. There's no discussion of behavioral economics, digital security, or public health. The focus is solely on AI and environmental sustainability.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the topics are T1 and T7 with their respective proportions and confidence levels. The subtopics are Neural Networks and Transfer Learning, both under T1, with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Transfer Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the application of machine learning techniques (neural networks and transfer learning) to enhance environmental monitoring, which falls under the broader topic of Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about knowledge adaptation in athletic performance analysis. The user wants me to identify the topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the abstract. It talks about using adaptability in data-driven models to improve predictions in sports. They mention conducting a literature review and expert interviews, and the results show significant improvements in prediction accuracy. The implications are for talent scouting, injury risk, and personalized coaching.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nThe abstract doesn't mention anything about sustainability, environment, or health, so T7, T8, T9, and T10 don't seem relevant. That leaves Machine Learning (T1) as the main topic. The study uses data-driven models, which are a part of machine learning. The methods involve reviewing literature and expert opinions, which are common in ML research. The focus on predictive models and adaptability aligns with ML's goal of making accurate predictions using algorithms.\n\nFor subtopics under T1, the codebook lists Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. The abstract doesn't specify any particular subtopic like neural networks or supervised learning. It's more about the general concept of adaptability in models, which isn't a specific subtopic listed. So, I don't identify any subtopics here.\n\nI'm confident that T1 is the main topic because the entire study revolves around data-driven models and predictive analytics, which are core to machine learning. The confidence level is high, around 4.5 out of 5. There's no mention of other topics, so the proportion allocated to T1 is 100%.\n\nIn summary, the abstract clearly falls under Machine Learning, focusing on the adaptability of models without delving into specific subtopics. Other topics from the codebook aren't present, so they're excluded.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the application of knowledge adaptation in data-driven models for athletic performance analysis, which aligns with the broader field of Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract and trying to figure out which topics and subtopics from the codebook are present. Let me start by reading through the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about how online platforms have changed decision-making, especially under uncertainty. It mentions human decision-making in the digital realm, cognitive biases, risk perception, and data-driven algorithms. They conducted an experiment to see how people weigh risks and benefits in social networking contexts. The results show a gap between self-reported risk attitudes and actual behavior. They used a clustering technique to identify user segments and linked them to risk profiles. The study integrates cognitive psychology and data analytics to inform risk communication strategies and suggests applications in personalized risk management tools and optimizing online platforms for safer decisions.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the study is about decision-making influenced by cognitive biases and risk perception. That sounds like Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract uses terms like cognitive biases, risk perception, and decision-making, which are all subtopics under T8. So, T8 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the study uses data-driven algorithms and clustering techniques. These are part of Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions employing a novel clustering technique, which is a subtopic under T1. So, T1 is another topic.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10). The focus is on decision-making and data analysis, so those other topics don't apply.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a good portion discussing decision-making, cognitive biases, and risk perception, which are under Behavioral Economics. That seems to take up about 60% of the abstract. The other 40% is about the data-driven methods and clustering, which fall under Machine Learning.\n\nFor confidence, I'm pretty sure about T8 because the abstract is heavily focused on decision-making and biases. I'm also confident about T1 since clustering is clearly a ML technique. So, confidence is high for both.\n\nLooking at subtopics, under T8, the abstract discusses cognitive biases and risk perception, which are subtopics. Under T1, the clustering technique is a subtopic. So, the subtopics are Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, and Clustering Technique.\n\nI think that's all. No other subtopics from the codebook are mentioned.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Clustering Technique\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses decision-making influenced by cognitive biases and risk perception, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses cognitive biases and their impact on user engagement in online platforms. It mentions specific cognitive biases like the availability heuristic and confirmation bias. The methodology includes an experimental design with a control and treatment group, measuring engagement metrics like likes, shares, and comments.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, and Public Health. The abstract doesn't mention any of these except for Behavioral Economics, which seems to fit because it deals with how cognitive biases affect decision-making, which is a core aspect of Behavioral Economics.\n\nNow, for the subtopics under Behavioral Economics, the options are Decision Making, Cognitive Biases, Risk Assessment, Social Preferences, and Intertemporal Choice. The abstract explicitly talks about cognitive biases, so that's a clear subtopic. There's no mention of the other subtopics, so I can confidently say Cognitive Biases is the only relevant one here.\n\nI should also consider if any other topics might be relevant. The study doesn't involve Machine Learning techniques, so T1 isn't applicable. Sustainable Development (T7) isn't mentioned either. Digital Security (T9) and Public Health (T10) aren't discussed, so they're out.\n\nIn terms of proportions, the entire abstract is focused on Behavioral Economics, so it's 100%. For confidence, since the abstract clearly discusses cognitive biases and their effects, I'm very confident, so a 5 out of 5.\n\nI don't see any overlap or ambiguity here. The focus is clearly on Behavioral Economics and its subtopic Cognitive Biases. There's no mention of other topics or subtopics, so I don't need to consider any other possibilities.\n\nSo, to summarize, the topic is Behavioral Economics (T8) with 100% proportion and confidence 5. The subtopic is Cognitive Biases with confidence 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on cognitive biases and their impact on user engagement, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

The study is purely about social factors and their effects on unions, so T10 is the only topic here.\n\nFor subtopics under Public Health, the abstract talks about disparities in health outcomes, which is a key aspect of Health Equity. The study identifies that lower-income individuals have worse union outcomes, which directly relates to disparities in access to resources and support. So, Health Equity (T10's subtopic) is definitely present.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from the codebook mentioned. They don't talk about Epidemiology, Health Promotion, Disease Prevention, or Health Systems in detail. The focus is solely on the equity aspect.\n\nSo, to summarize, the main topic is Public Health (T10) with a significant portion of the abstract dedicated to it. The subtopic is Health Equity, as the study highlights disparities based on socioeconomic status.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on the impact of socioeconomic factors on conjugal union outcomes, which falls under Public Health (T10).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that investigates how union formation (like marriage or cohabitation) affects health outcomes among vulnerable populations. They used a mixed-methods approach, surveying 1,500 individuals. The findings show that people in unions have better health outcomes, such as lower rates of hypertension and diabetes. It also mentions that social isolation is more common among singles, worsening health issues. The study highlights mediating factors like socioeconomic status, education, and healthcare access. They found that lower socioeconomic individuals in unions had better health, while singles had worse outcomes. The study suggests that union formation can be a critical determinant of health, with implications for policymakers and healthcare providers. It calls for more research on the intersection of union formation, social support, and health disparities.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics are relevant.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Public Health (T10). The study is about health outcomes, disparities, and interventions, which are all within public health. The abstract discusses health disparities, health outcomes, and policy implications, which are subtopics under Public Health. The methods used are mixed-methods, which is a research methodology, but the focus is on health outcomes, so T10 is the primary topic.\n\nNext, I should check if any other topics are present. The study doesn't mention machine learning, sustainable development, behavioral economics, or digital security. It's purely about health and policy, so only T10 is relevant.\n\nFor subtopics under T10, the abstract mentions health disparities, health outcomes, and policy implications. Specifically, it talks about health disparities (how different groups fare), health outcomes (specific health metrics), and the need for policy interventions. These are all listed as subtopics under Public Health in the codebook.\n\nI don't see any other subtopics from other topics being relevant here. The study doesn't discuss behavioral economics aspects like decision-making or cognitive biases, nor does it involve any digital security or sustainable development elements.\n\nSo, the analysis would identify T10 as the main topic, with a high proportion of the abstract dedicated to it. The subtopics would be Health Disparities, Health Outcomes, and Health Systems (since policy is part of health systems). I'm confident about these identifications because the abstract explicitly discusses these areas without delving into other fields.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Disparities\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Outcomes\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Systems\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on health outcomes, disparities, and policy implications, all within Public Health (T10).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the relationship between risk perception, cognitive biases, and proactive security measures in educational environments. It mentions using a correlational methodology and explores how cognitive biases like the availability heuristic affect the adoption of security measures. The study's findings suggest that institutions with higher perceived risk invest more in proactive measures, while cognitive biases can either underestimate or overestimate threat likelihood, impacting their investment decisions.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic. The abstract focuses on how psychological factors influence security behaviors in institutions. This falls under Behavioral Economics (T8), as it deals with decision-making and cognitive biases in an economic context, even though the context here is security rather than traditional economics.\n\nNext, the subtopics. The abstract specifically mentions cognitive biases (e.g., availability heuristic) and risk perception, which are subtopics under Behavioral Economics. So, the subtopics here are \"Cognitive Biases\" and \"Risk Assessment.\"\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract. The focus is purely on the behavioral aspects influencing security measures, so those other topics aren't relevant here.\n\nFor the proportion, since the entire abstract is about Behavioral Economics, it's 100%. The confidence is high because the abstract clearly discusses elements within Behavioral Economics without delving into other areas.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to Behavioral Economics as the primary topic with two relevant subtopics, and no other topics are present.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses cognitive biases and risk perception in the context of security measures, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its content.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that looks at the interplay between risk management, decision-making, and wellbeing in educational settings. It mentions using a correlational design, self-report measures, and survey data. The key constructs are risk management, decision-making, and wellbeing, with a focus on how these elements interact among students.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics align with the abstract's content.\n\nFirst, considering the topics:\n\n1. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The abstract deals with decision-making and risk management, which are central to Behavioral Economics. The study examines how students perceive risk and make decisions, which directly relates to the subtopics of Decision Making and Risk Assessment under T8.\n\n2. **Public Health (T10)**: While the abstract focuses on educational settings, it touches on wellbeing, which can be related to public health concerns. However, the primary focus is on the behavioral aspects rather than public health policies or epidemiology, so this might be a secondary topic.\n\nNext, looking at the subtopics:\n\n- **Decision Making**: The study examines how students make decisions, influenced by their risk perceptions. This is a clear subtopic under Behavioral Economics.\n- **Risk Assessment**: The abstract discusses students' risk perceptions and strategies, which fall under Risk Assessment.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, or Digital Security in the abstract, so those topics can be ruled out.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions:\n\n- Behavioral Economics (T8) is the primary focus, as the study revolves around decision-making and risk management. I'd estimate around 70% of the abstract is dedicated to this topic.\n- Public Health (T10) is mentioned in the context of wellbeing but is less emphasized. I'd allocate about 30% to this topic.\n\nFor confidence ratings:\n\n- T8: High confidence (4/5) because the study clearly deals with decision-making and risk, which are core to Behavioral Economics.\n- T10: Moderate confidence (3/5) since wellbeing is a factor but not the central focus.\n\nRegarding subtopics, both Decision Making and Risk Assessment are well-supported by the abstract's content, so confidence is high for both (4/5 each).\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The study's methodology and focus are on the behavioral aspects, so Behavioral Economics is the main topic, with Decision Making and Risk Assessment as subtopics. Public Health is a secondary topic because it relates to the outcomes (wellbeing) but isn't the primary focus.\n\nI should also check if any other subtopics from other topics might apply, but nothing else seems relevant here.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to Behavioral Economics as the main topic with significant proportions, supported by the relevant subtopics, and a minor connection to Public Health.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.7,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.3,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses decision-making and risk management in educational settings, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses how educational institutions use data-driven approaches to improve student outcomes while also focusing on environmental sustainability and data protection. It mentions a correlational study examining the relationship between data-driven decision-making and environmental sustainability. The study found that institutions with strong data protection measures were more likely to engage in eco-friendly practices. It also highlights the use of data analytics for environmental improvements, such as optimizing energy consumption and reducing waste.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to map these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract talks about data-driven decision-making, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). The methods used include data analytics, which is a part of Machine Learning. So, T1 is definitely present. The proportion of the abstract related to Machine Learning seems significant, as the study revolves around data-driven approaches. I'd estimate around 60% of the abstract is about this topic, with high confidence (4/5).\n\nNext, the abstract emphasizes environmental sustainability and data protection. Sustainable Development (T7) is the relevant topic here, as it deals with balancing environmental protection with other needs. The study's focus on eco-friendly practices and resource management aligns with T7. I'd allocate about 40% of the abstract to this topic, with a confidence rating of 4/5.\n\nLooking at subtopics, the abstract mentions data protection measures, which is a part of Digital Security (T9's subtopic). However, since the codebook's subtopics are under each main topic, I need to check if \"Data Protection\" is listed. Wait, under T9, the subtopics include \"Cybersecurity,\" \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies,\" etc., but \"Data Protection\" isn't explicitly listed. Therefore, it might not be a direct subtopic. Alternatively, \"Data Protection\" could be considered under \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies,\" but it's a bit of a stretch. Given the codebook, I might not assign a subtopic here, or perhaps consider \"Resource Management\" under T7, but that's more about environmental aspects.\n\nWait, the abstract mentions \"data protection measures,\" which is more about Digital Security. Since the codebook's T9 includes subtopics like \"Cybersecurity\" and \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies,\" but not \"Data Protection\" specifically, I might not have a direct subtopic match. Alternatively, if I consider \"Data Protection\" as part of \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies,\" I could assign that as a subtopic with moderate confidence (3/5).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the subtopic isn't explicitly covered, so I might not assign any subtopics beyond the main topics. But since the abstract does discuss data protection, which is a part of Digital Security, I think it's reasonable to include \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\" as a subtopic, even if it's a stretch.\n\nWait, but the codebook's subtopics for T9 are specific, so \"Data Protection\" isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps I shouldn't assign a subtopic here. Alternatively, maybe \"Resource Management\" under T7 is applicable since the study talks about optimizing resource allocation. That could be a subtopic with moderate confidence (3/5).\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Topics: T1 (60%) and T7 (40%)\n- Subtopics: \"Resource Management\" under T7 (confidence 3/5) and possibly \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\" under T9 (confidence 3/5), but since the codebook doesn't list \"Data Protection,\" I'm uncertain.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about integrating AI and data analytics to improve the resilience of educational institutions against climate disruptions. The user wants me to code this using their predefined codebook. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The abstract mentions AI and data analytics, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). It also talks about climate-induced disruptions and resilience, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). I don't see any mention of Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10), so those can be ruled out.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion each topic takes. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing AI and data analytics, their integration, and the methods used. That's probably around 60%. The rest, about 40%, is about climate change and institutional resilience, which is Sustainable Development.\n\nNext, confidence levels. I'm pretty sure about Machine Learning because AI and data analytics are clearly part of it. So, confidence 5. For Sustainable Development, it's a bit less direct since it's about resilience and climate, but it still fits. I'll give it a 4.\n\nMoving on to subtopics. Under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract specifically talks about AI-driven data analytics, which is a form of supervised learning. So, Supervised Learning is a subtopic here. I'm confident about that, so confidence 4.\n\nFor Sustainable Development (T7), the focus is on how institutions prepare for climate-related events, which ties into Climate Change Mitigation. That's a clear subtopic. I'll rate my confidence at 4 here as well.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not mixing up topics and subtopics. The main topics are the broader areas, while subtopics are the specific aspects within them. The abstract doesn't mention any other subtopics from the codebook, so I'll stick with these two.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the relevant subtopics. I'll also include a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics based on the content of the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Climate Change Mitigation\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of AI and data analytics (Machine Learning) to enhance resilience against climate-induced disruptions (Sustainable Development).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on human decision-making in the context of physical activity. It mentions integrating computational methods with insights from human psychology. Key points include examining cognitive biases and heuristics affecting exercise choices, using a mixed-methods approach with surveys and machine-driven simulations, and finding that reward mechanisms can enhance exercise adherence.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions machine-driven simulations, which fall under computational methods. This suggests the use of Machine Learning techniques, specifically supervised or unsupervised learning, as part of the methodology. So, T1 is present.\n\nNext, Behavioral Economics (T8) is clearly relevant. The study focuses on cognitive biases, decision-making, and heuristics, all of which are core aspects of Behavioral Economics. The subtopics mentioned include Decision Making and Cognitive Biases, which are part of T8's subtopics.\n\nPublic Health (T10) is another relevant topic. The study's implications are discussed in terms of adaptive exercise programs, wearable technology, and personalized health coaching, which are all within the scope of Public Health. The subtopics here might include Health Promotion and Disease Prevention.\n\nSustainable Development (T7) and Digital Security (T9) don't seem to be directly addressed in the abstract. There's no mention of renewable energy, climate change, resource management, environmental monitoring, or sustainable cities. Similarly, there's no discussion of cybersecurity, privacy technologies, authentication, threat detection, or security policies.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing Behavioral Economics, particularly cognitive biases and decision-making, which might take up about 40%. Machine Learning is used as a method, so that's around 30%. Public Health is mentioned in the implications, so maybe 20%. The remaining 10% could be other unspecified areas.\n\nFor confidence, I'm quite sure about Behavioral Economics (4/5) and Machine Learning (4/5). Public Health is a bit less certain since it's more about the application rather than the core focus (3/5).\n\nRegarding subtopics, the abstract clearly discusses Cognitive Biases and Decision Making under Behavioral Economics. These are directly mentioned, so confidence is high (4/5 each). There's also a mention of reward scheduling and feedback mechanisms, which could relate to other subtopics, but they aren't explicitly listed in the codebook, so I won't include them.\n\nIn summary, the topics identified are T8 (Behavioral Economics), T1 (Machine Learning), and T10 (Public Health). The subtopics are Cognitive Biases and Decision Making.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 20,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses human decision-making patterns and cognitive biases, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses integrating human decision-making with adaptive systems to improve physical activity interventions. It mentions decision-making under uncertainty and adaptive feedback mechanisms. The study's findings suggest that adaptive feedback can enhance intervention effectiveness.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I consider Machine Learning (T1). The abstract talks about adaptive systems and feedback mechanisms, which are related to Machine Learning concepts like adaptive algorithms or reinforcement learning. However, the term \"Machine Learning\" isn't explicitly mentioned, so it's a bit of a stretch. I'll rate this as a 3 out of 5 confidence.\n\nNext, Public Health (T10) seems relevant because the study focuses on physical activity interventions, which fall under public health initiatives. The abstract discusses the development of interventions and their impact on health outcomes, clearly aligning with Public Health. I'll assign a higher confidence here, maybe a 4 out of 5.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is another possible topic since the study involves human decision-making and factors influencing behavior. However, the abstract doesn't delve deeply into economic theories or behavioral models, so it's a bit tangential. I'll give it a 2 out of 5 confidence.\n\nSustainable Development (T7) and Digital Security (T9) don't seem relevant here. The abstract doesn't mention environmental factors, resource management, cybersecurity, or privacy issues, so I can exclude these.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract specifically mentions \"decision-making under uncertainty,\" which aligns with the Behavioral Economics subtopic \"Decision Making.\" Additionally, the adaptive feedback mechanisms could relate to Machine Learning's \"Reinforcement Learning\" or \"Supervised Learning,\" but since the abstract doesn't specify the type of learning, I'll stick with \"Decision Making\" as the primary subtopic.\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Machine Learning and Public Health, with a focus on the Decision Making subtopic. I'll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring the proportions sum to 100% and confidence ratings reflect the analysis.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the integration of human decision-making and adaptive systems, which relates to Behavioral Economics (T8) through the subtopic of Decision Making.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study on exercise adherence, focusing on how human decision-making, uncertainty, and technological interventions interact. They used a quasi-experimental design with two groups: one with a conventional routine and another with an adaptive regimen using an algorithm for real-time feedback. The findings show that the adaptive system improved adherence, especially among those with higher uncertainty aversion.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, for TOPICS:\n\n1. **Behavioral Economics (T8)**: The study examines decision-making under uncertainty, which is a core aspect of Behavioral Economics. The mention of uncertainty aversion and risk-taking in a controlled setting also ties into this topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing these psychological factors, so I estimate about 40% of the content here.\n\n2. **Machine Learning (T1)**: The adaptive system uses an algorithm with pattern recognition and predictive modeling, which are elements of Machine Learning. This is a key part of the methodology, so I'd allocate around 30% to this topic.\n\n3. **Public Health (T10)**: The study's implications are discussed in terms of improving health outcomes and reducing chronic disease burdens, which falls under Public Health. This is a substantial part of the conclusion, so I'd assign about 30% here.\n\nNext, for SUBTOPICS:\n\n- **Decision Making (T8.1)**: The study looks at how individuals make decisions regarding exercise, especially under uncertainty. This is a central theme, so confidence is high (4/5).\n\n- **Supervised Learning (T1.3)**: The algorithm uses predictive modeling, which is a form of Supervised Learning. However, the abstract doesn't go into much detail about the specifics of the algorithm, so confidence is moderate (3/5).\n\nI need to ensure that the topics and subtopics are correctly distinguished. Behavioral Economics is the broader field studying decision-making, while Decision Making is the specific subtopic. Similarly, Machine Learning is the broader topic, with Supervised Learning being the subtopic related to the algorithm used.\n\nI should also check if any other topics like Sustainable Development or Digital Security are mentioned, but they don't seem relevant here. The focus is on human behavior and technology in a health context, so T8, T1, and T10 are the main topics.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the subtopics with their confidence ratings. The explanation will clarify how each topic and subtopic was distinguished based on the abstract's content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses decision-making under uncertainty (Behavioral Economics, T8) and the use of an algorithm for adaptive feedback (Machine Learning, T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that integrates insights from behavioral science, computer systems, and artificial intelligence to understand decision-making in physical activities. They developed a framework that considers both individual risk perception and system anomaly detection. They used machine learning algorithms and a quasi-experimental design with wearable devices. The findings show improved decision-making and risk perception among participants using the system.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the study mentions behavioral science, which relates to Behavioral Economics (T8). The abstract talks about decision-making processes, which is a subtopic under T8. So, T8 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, the study uses machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning (T1) is another topic. The subtopics under T1 include Supervised Learning, but the abstract doesn't specify the type of machine learning used, just that it's employed for analyzing data and providing feedback. So, T1 is present, but the subtopic isn't explicitly clear beyond the general use of machine learning.\n\nThe abstract also mentions integrating insights from computer systems and artificial intelligence, but these aren't directly mapped to the codebook topics. However, the focus on decision-making and risk perception aligns more with Behavioral Economics (T8) and the use of machine learning (T1).\n\nLooking at the codebook, Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10) don't seem relevant here. The study doesn't discuss sustainability, security issues, or public health policies.\n\nFor the topics, I'll identify T8 and T1. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing decision-making and risk perception, which are core to Behavioral Economics. The machine learning aspect is integral but perhaps a bit less extensive than the behavioral elements. So, I'll estimate T8 at 60% and T1 at 40%.\n\nRegarding subtopics, under T8, Decision Making is clearly present. Under T1, Supervised Learning isn't explicitly mentioned, but since machine learning is used, it's a possible subtopic, though confidence is lower.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping with subtopics. The abstract doesn't specify the type of machine learning, so I can't confidently assign a subtopic beyond the general T1. However, since the framework uses machine learning for analysis, it's reasonable to consider Supervised Learning as a possible subtopic, but with lower confidence.\n\nSo, the final identification is T8 and T1 as topics, with Decision Making as a subtopic under T8 and Supervised Learning as a possible subtopic under T1, though with lower confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses decision-making processes influenced by behavioral science and computer systems, aligning with Behavioral Economics (T8).

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the prediction and prevention of athletic injuries using advanced data analytics and physiological markers. It mentions developing a predictive model by integrating large datasets, using a correlational approach, and identifying key factors like athlete characteristics, training load metrics, and physiological markers. The study's implications are in athlete selection, training programs, and injury prevention, aiming to create safer athletic environments.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to see which topics are present. The main areas discussed are data analytics, which falls under Machine Learning (T1), and the application of these methods to improve athlete well-being and performance, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7) in terms of creating sustainable athletic environments.\n\nFor subtopics, the study uses a correlational approach, which is a method under Supervised Learning (T1.3). It also focuses on creating sustainable environments, which is part of Sustainable Cities (T7.5).\n\nI'll estimate the proportions: about 70% of the abstract is about Machine Learning (T1) and 30% about Sustainable Development (T7). The confidence for T1 is high (5/5) because the methods are clearly data-driven. For T7, it's a bit lower (4/5) since the connection to sustainable development is more about the application rather than the core methodology.\n\nIn the disambiguation explanation, I'll note that the primary focus is on the methodology (Machine Learning) and the application (Sustainable Development), distinguishing them based on their roles in the study.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.7,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.3,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Sustainable Cities\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the use of advanced data analytics (a Machine Learning technique) to predict injury risk, which falls under the broader topic of Machine Learning (T1).

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a study that uses artificial neural networks to optimize athletic performance. It mentions the application of these networks in predicting and optimizing complex systems related to athletic performance. The methodology involves collecting data from athletes using various assessments and feeding it into an artificial neural network model. The results show high accuracy in predictions, and the study highlights the potential for this technology in sports science.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topic here is clearly Machine Learning (T1) because the study heavily relies on artificial neural networks, which fall under this category. The abstract doesn't mention any other topics like Sustainable Development, Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, or Public Health. So, T1 is the only topic present.\n\nFor subtopics, the codebook under T1 includes Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, etc. The abstract specifically talks about artificial neural networks, so the subtopic is Neural Networks. There's no mention of other subtopics like Reinforcement Learning or Supervised Learning, so only Neural Networks is relevant.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract focused on Machine Learning. The entire study is about applying neural networks, so almost the whole abstract is about T1. I'd say around 90%. The remaining 10% might be about the application in sports, but that's still under the broader Machine Learning topic.\n\nConfidence for T1 is high, a 5, since it's central to the study. For the subtopic Neural Networks, confidence is also high, a 5, as it's explicitly mentioned throughout the abstract.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not missing any other topics. The abstract doesn't discuss sustainability, behavioral economics, digital security, or public health issues. It's purely about using machine learning techniques in sports performance. So, no other topics or subtopics apply here.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to T1 as the main topic with a significant portion of the abstract dedicated to it, and Neural Networks as the subtopic. The confidence levels are high for both.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.9,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of artificial neural networks, which falls under the Machine Learning (T1) topic.

The study is about improving childcare efficiency, not about environmental sustainability, human behavior, digital threats, or public health systems. \n\nFor subtopics, the use of an algorithm falls under Supervised Learning since it's about using data to make predictions or decisions. There's no indication of other subtopics like Neural Networks or Reinforcement Learning being used here. \n\nSo, the main topic is Machine Learning with a high confidence level, and the subtopic is Supervised Learning, also with high confidence.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm looking at this abstract about optimizing urban childcare services using Reinforcement Learning and Adaptive Policy Frameworks. The user wants me to code this using their predefined codebook. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The abstract mentions Reinforcement Learning (RL), which is a subtopic under Machine Learning (T1). So, Machine Learning is definitely a topic here. The study is about public policy and urban planning, which falls under Public Health (T10). There's also a focus on policy frameworks and their application, which ties into Behavioral Economics (T8) because it involves decision-making processes.\n\nNext, I'll estimate the proportion each topic takes. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing RL and its integration with APFs, so Machine Learning might take up about 40%. Public Health, focusing on policy and urban aspects, could be around 35%. Behavioral Economics, dealing with decision-making in policies, might be 25%.\n\nFor subtopics, Reinforcement Learning (T1) is clearly mentioned. The abstract also talks about policy interventions and decision-making, which relates to Decision Making under Behavioral Economics (T8). So, both of these subtopics are present.\n\nI need to make sure I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention anything about cybersecurity or privacy, so Digital Security (T9) isn't relevant here. Sustainable Development (T7) isn't directly addressed either.\n\nIn terms of confidence, I'm pretty sure about Machine Learning and Public Health, so I'll rate them a 5. Behavioral Economics is a bit less direct, but still relevant, so I'll give it a 4.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response with the identified topics, their proportions, confidence levels, and the subtopics with their confidence. I'll also include a brief explanation of how I distinguished between topics and subtopics based on the abstract's content.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Reinforcement Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract explicitly mentions 'Reinforcement Learning (RL)' and its application in optimizing urban childcare services, clearly linking to the Machine Learning (T1) topic.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the development of predictive models for disease prevention in educational contexts. It mentions integrating cognitive psychology and statistical modeling, using a mixed-methods approach that includes qualitative interviews, quantitative analysis, and predictive models. It also talks about cognitive biases enhancing model effectiveness and implications for public health policies.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10).\n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract mentions predictive models and statistical techniques, which are related to ML. However, it doesn't specify any subtopics like Neural Networks or Supervised Learning, so ML is present but not the main focus.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7) doesn't seem relevant here. The focus is on disease prevention in education, not environmental or resource management aspects.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) is a strong candidate. The abstract discusses cognitive biases, which is a subtopic under T8. This suggests that the study is applying principles from behavioral economics to improve decision-making.\n\nDigital Security (T9) isn't mentioned at all. There's no talk about cybersecurity or privacy technologies.\n\nPublic Health (T10) is definitely present. The study is about disease prevention strategies, which falls under public health. The abstract also mentions implications for health policies and outcomes, reinforcing this topic.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: Public Health seems to be the primary focus, taking up about 60% of the abstract. Behavioral Economics is significant, around 30%, and Machine Learning is minor, about 10%.\n\nFor subtopics, under Behavioral Economics, cognitive biases are explicitly mentioned, so that's a clear subtopic. Under Public Health, the abstract discusses disease prevention strategies, which is a subtopic.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics and subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while subtopics are the specific areas within them. The abstract clearly discusses cognitive biases (a subtopic of Behavioral Economics) and disease prevention (a subtopic of Public Health).\n\nI think I've covered all relevant points. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, making sure to include the confidence levels and explanations.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 10,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses public health through disease prevention strategies, making T10 the main topic.

The user wants me to code this using their predefined codebook. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to identify the main topics. The abstract talks about using machine learning algorithms and behavioral insights. Machine learning is clearly under T1, and behavioral insights fall under Behavioral Economics, which is T8. I don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), or Public Health (T10), so those are out.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing machine learning, especially in the context of adaptive assessments. That's probably around 60%. The rest, about 40%, is about behavioral economics, specifically cognitive biases and decision-making.\n\nNext, the subtopics. Under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract mentions machine learning algorithms, which is a broad term but fits under the main topic. For Behavioral Economics (T8), they talk about cognitive biases and decision-making, which are both subtopics. So, I'll note those.\n\nI'm confident about T1 and T8 because the abstract explicitly mentions machine learning and cognitive biases. The subtopics are directly referenced, so my confidence is high there too.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing any other subtopics. The abstract doesn't mention reinforcement learning or other ML subtopics, just the general use. Similarly, for Behavioral Economics, it's focused on cognitive biases and decision-making, not the others like risk assessment or social preferences.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should reflect T1 and T8 as the main topics with their proportions and confidence, and the subtopics as specified.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of social media leading to increased data generation, which raises privacy and environmental sustainability concerns. It talks about deploying advanced cryptographic protocols, decentralized data storage, homomorphic encryption, distributed ledger technologies, renewable energy, and energy-efficient server designs. The study's findings suggest these measures reduce both identity theft and carbon emissions.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract mentions cryptographic protocols and decentralized systems, which fall under Digital Security (T9). The subtopics here would be Cryptography (though not explicitly listed, it's part of Digital Security) and maybe Privacy Enhancing Technologies. However, the codebook's subtopics for T9 are Cybersecurity, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Authentication Methods, Threat Detection, and Security Policy. Since the abstract uses cryptographic protocols and decentralized storage, I think Privacy Enhancing Technologies is the best fit here.\n\nNext, the abstract addresses environmental sustainability and carbon emissions, which relates to Sustainable Development (T7). The subtopics mentioned are Renewable Energy and Resource Management. The study talks about renewable energy sources and energy-efficient servers, so Renewable Energy is definitely a subtopic here. Resource Management might also be applicable since it's about optimizing data storage and processing to reduce environmental impact.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is on security and sustainability, so those topics aren't relevant here.\n\nFor the proportions, the abstract spends about 60% discussing Digital Security (T9) and 40% on Sustainable Development (T7). The confidence for T9 is high (4/5) because it's clearly about security measures. For T7, it's also high (4/5) as the environmental aspects are well-detailed.\n\nIn terms of subtopics, Privacy Enhancing Technologies and Renewable Energy are clearly mentioned, so their confidence is high (4/5 each). Resource Management is a bit more inferred, so maybe a 3/5, but since the abstract doesn't explicitly mention it, I might not include it.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the topics are T9 and T7 with their respective proportions and confidences. The subtopics are Privacy Enhancing Technologies and Renewable Energy, both with high confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Renewable Energy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of cryptographic protocols and decentralized systems, which fall under Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the environmental impact of social media platforms, focusing on data-intensive activities and their energy consumption. It mentions a quasi-experimental study using context-aware information hiding mechanisms to reduce carbon footprints. The methods include a mixed-methods approach with experiments on a social media platform. The results show significant reductions in energy consumption and emissions, and the implications suggest further development of these mechanisms.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match the content to the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Sustainable Development (T7) because the study is about reducing the environmental impact of online activities, which relates to environmental protection and resource management. The abstract talks about carbon footprints, energy consumption, and strategies to mitigate these, all of which fall under Sustainable Development.\n\nNext, the study uses context-aware information hiding mechanisms. This sounds like a technical method, possibly related to Machine Learning (T1). Context-aware mechanisms could involve algorithms or models, which are part of Machine Learning. However, the abstract doesn't explicitly mention Machine Learning terms, so my confidence here is lower.\n\nLooking at the subtopics, within Sustainable Development, the study deals with environmental impact and strategies to reduce it, which fits under Environmental Monitoring (T7.4). The context-aware mechanisms might relate to Resource Management (T7.3) as well, but I'm less certain about that.\n\nI don't see evidence of other topics like Behavioral Economics, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract. The focus is on environmental impact and technical solutions, so those topics don't apply here.\n\nFor proportions, since the majority of the abstract discusses environmental impact and strategies, Sustainable Development (T7) takes up about 70%. The technical aspect of context-aware mechanisms, which might relate to Machine Learning, takes up the remaining 30%, but I'm not entirely sure if it's directly under Machine Learning or another subtopic.\n\nIn summary, the main topic is Sustainable Development with a focus on Environmental Monitoring. The mention of context-aware mechanisms might touch on Machine Learning, but it's not clearly defined, so my confidence is moderate.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Environmental Monitoring\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Resource Management\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the environmental impact of social media and strategies to reduce it, aligning with Sustainable Development (T7).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by carefully reading the abstract to understand its main focus.\n\nThe abstract discusses decision-making processes in caregiving settings. It mentions cognitive biases, heuristics, emotional influences, and social pressures. Theoretical frameworks from human decision-making are applied, and the study's findings suggest the need for evidence-based protocols to support caregivers.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Behavioral Economics (T8) because the abstract deals with decision-making, cognitive biases, and heuristics, which are core elements of this field. The study's focus on how psychological and social factors influence decisions aligns with Behavioral Economics.\n\nNext, I'll consider the proportion of the abstract related to T8. The entire abstract revolves around decision-making processes, cognitive biases, and their implications, so I estimate that about 80% of the content is dedicated to Behavioral Economics. My confidence in this identification is high, so I'll rate it a 5.\n\nNow, looking for subtopics under T8, the abstract specifically mentions cognitive biases and decision-making. These are listed as subtopics in the codebook. The discussion of mental shortcuts (heuristics) and emotional influences ties directly into these subtopics. Therefore, both \"Decision Making\" and \"Cognitive Biases\" are present. My confidence in identifying these subtopics is also high, so I'll rate each at 5.\n\nI don't see any mention of other topics like Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health in the abstract. The focus is purely on the decision-making process within caregiving, which falls under Behavioral Economics.\n\nIn summary, the abstract clearly falls under Behavioral Economics with a strong emphasis on its subtopics related to decision-making and cognitive biases. There's no overlap with other topics, so the analysis is straightforward.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 80,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on decision-making processes in caregiving settings, specifically examining cognitive biases and heuristics.

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses decision-making processes by parents when selecting child-care services, focusing on cognitive biases. It mentions concepts like heuristics, availability heuristic, affect heuristic, framing effect, and sunk cost fallacy. These terms are all related to Behavioral Economics, specifically the subtopics within that field.\n\nLooking at the codebook, Behavioral Economics (T8) is the main topic here. The abstract doesn't mention any other fields like Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, Digital Security, or Public Health. So, T8 is the only topic present.\n\nFor subtopics, the abstract clearly references several: Cognitive Biases, Decision Making, and Risk Assessment. These are all subtopics under T8. There's no mention of other subtopics from different topics, so I can confidently list these three.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract focused on Behavioral Economics. The entire study revolves around this topic, so it's 100%. My confidence is high, a 5/5.\n\nFor subtopics, each is well-supported. Cognitive Biases are central, so confidence is 5. Decision Making is also a major focus, so 5. Risk Assessment is mentioned, but perhaps a bit less prominently, so maybe 4.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The abstract doesn't discuss methodologies from other fields, so it's clear that Behavioral Economics is the main topic with its subtopics highlighted.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response accordingly, making sure to include all identified topics and subtopics with their respective proportions and confidence levels.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Risk Assessment\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on decision-making processes influenced by cognitive biases, which falls under Behavioral Economics (T8).

    },
    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses a correlational study that uses advanced pattern recognition techniques to optimize educational interventions for adolescents' well-being. It mentions leveraging large datasets and sophisticated algorithms to identify relationships between various factors influencing intervention effectiveness. The study highlights the integration of algorithmic models with contextual data and traditional statistical methods, showing improved predictive accuracy. It also emphasizes the importance of tailoring interventions to individual needs.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to see which topics and subtopics match the content of the abstract.\n\nFirst, the abstract talks about using advanced pattern recognition techniques, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). The techniques mentioned, like algorithms and predictive models, are part of Machine Learning methodologies. The subtopics under T1 include Supervised Learning, which is relevant here because the study uses data to predict outcomes, indicating a supervised approach.\n\nNext, the study's focus is on educational interventions aimed at promoting well-being among adolescents. This relates to Public Health (T10), as it deals with health-related issues and interventions at a population level. The subtopics under T10 include Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, which are directly addressed in the study's goals and findings.\n\nI don't see evidence of Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), or Digital Security (T9) in the abstract. The focus is on health interventions and machine learning techniques, so those other topics aren't applicable here.\n\nNow, estimating the proportion of the abstract dedicated to each topic. The abstract spends a significant portion discussing the use of pattern recognition and algorithms, which are Machine Learning techniques. This likely takes up about 60% of the content. The remaining 40% is dedicated to the public health aspects, such as the interventions and their impact on adolescent well-being.\n\nFor confidence ratings, I'm very confident about Machine Learning (T1) since the abstract clearly uses these techniques. Public Health (T10) is also confidently identified, though slightly less so than T1 because the focus is more on the application of techniques than the public health framework itself.\n\nRegarding subtopics, Supervised Learning is clearly relevant as the study uses data to predict outcomes, which is a supervised approach. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention are also relevant as the study aims to improve well-being and prevent health issues.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not conflating topics and subtopics. The main topics are the broader fields, while subtopics are the specific areas within those fields. The abstract discusses the application of Machine Learning (topic) using Supervised Learning (subtopic) in the context of Public Health (topic) with a focus on Health Promotion (subtopic).\n\nI think I've covered all relevant points. Now, I'll structure this into the required JSON format, making sure to only include the identified topics and subtopics with their respective proportions and confidence levels.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.6,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.4,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of advanced pattern recognition techniques, which fall under Machine Learning (T1), particularly Supervised Learning.

The focus is solely on machine learning applications in education, so those other topics aren't relevant here.\n\nFor the proportion, since the entire abstract is about machine learning, T1 would take up 100% of the content. The confidence is high because the abstract clearly states the use of machine learning techniques and models.\n\nRegarding subtopics, Neural Networks and Supervised Learning are explicitly mentioned. The confidence for these subtopics is also high as they are directly discussed in the methodology and results sections of the abstract.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main topic is Machine Learning, and within that, the subtopics are the specific techniques used. There's no overlap with other domains like Sustainable Development or Public Health, so I can confidently stick with T1 and its subtopics.\n\nFinally, I'll structure the JSON response as required, making sure to include the topic, its proportion, confidence, and the identified subtopics with their confidence levels. The disambiguation explanation should clarify why only T1 is relevant and how the subtopics were identified.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Neural Networks\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of machine learning techniques, specifically neural networks and supervised learning, in the context of educational prediction models.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of data-driven learning tools in early childhood education and the associated risks of sensitive information disclosure. It mentions an experimental study on confidentiality measures, specifically using methods like homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. The study involves childcare professionals and young children, and it highlights the importance of training and support for these professionals. It also touches on the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving policymakers, educators, and technology developers.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Digital Security (T9). The abstract focuses on confidentiality measures, data breaches, and encryption techniques, all of which fall under Digital Security. The proportion of the abstract dedicated to this topic is significant, as the study's core is about protecting sensitive data.\n\nNext, the abstract also touches on Public Health (T10). It mentions the well-being of young children, the quality of care, and the reduction of administrative errors, which relate to public health concerns. However, this is a secondary focus, so the proportion is smaller.\n\nLooking at subtopics, the study specifically uses homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation, which are part of the Digital Security subtopic \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies.\" The confidence here is high because these are explicitly mentioned.\n\nAdditionally, the abstract discusses the need for comprehensive training and support for childcare professionals, which relates to \"Security Policy\" under Digital Security. This is a bit more inferred but still relevant.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, or Behavioral Economics in the abstract, so those topics aren't applicable here.\n\nTo summarize, the primary topic is Digital Security with a significant portion of the abstract, followed by Public Health as a supporting topic. The subtopics identified are Privacy Enhancing Technologies and Security Policy, both within Digital Security.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Privacy Enhancing Technologies\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Security Policy\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses confidentiality measures in early childhood education, which falls under Digital Security (T9).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the application of advanced cryptographic protocols to protect sensitive information in childcare settings. It mentions safeguarding data, using a mixed-methods approach, and evaluating the effectiveness of these protocols. The study's implications are highlighted for various domains, including early childhood education, healthcare, and social services.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the possible topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I consider Machine Learning (T1). The abstract doesn't mention any machine learning techniques, algorithms, or methodologies. It focuses on cryptographic protocols, which are more related to security rather than machine learning. So, T1 is not present.\n\nNext, Sustainable Development (T7). The abstract doesn't discuss sustainability, renewable energy, climate change, or resource management. The focus is on data security in childcare, so T7 isn't relevant here.\n\nBehavioral Economics (T8) involves decision-making, cognitive biases, etc. The abstract doesn't delve into economic decisions or human behavior in that context. It's more about technical security measures, so T8 isn't applicable.\n\nDigital Security (T9) is about protecting data and systems. The abstract explicitly talks about cryptographic protocols, data protection, and security in childcare settings. This aligns well with T9. The entire study revolves around enhancing digital security, so the proportion here is 100%.\n\nPublic Health (T10) deals with population health, epidemiology, etc. While the abstract mentions implications for healthcare, it's more about the application of security measures rather than public health issues. So, T10 isn't the primary focus.\n\nFor subtopics under T9, the abstract mentions cryptographic protocols, which fall under Digital Security. However, the codebook's subtopics for T9 are Cybersecurity, Privacy Enhancing Technologies, Authentication Methods, Threat Detection, and Security Policy. The abstract doesn't specifically mention any of these subtopics beyond the general use of cryptographic protocols. Therefore, no subtopics are explicitly identified.\n\nIn summary, the main topic is Digital Security (T9) with a 100% proportion, and no subtopics are explicitly mentioned in the abstract.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 100,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract focuses on cryptographic protocols and data protection, which fall under Digital Security (T9).

The rest, around 40%, is about the environmental impact and sustainable practices, which falls under T7.\n\nConfidence for T1 is high because of the explicit mention of supervised learning. For T7, it's also high as the study's main focus is on environmental sustainability.\n\nSubtopics: The use of supervised data analysis techniques directly points to Supervised Learning under T1. There's no mention of other subtopics from T7, so only Supervised Learning is identified.\n\nSo, compiling this, the JSON structure will reflect T1 and T7 as topics with their proportions and confidence, and Supervised Learning as the subtopic.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.6,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T7\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.4,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of data-driven approaches and supervised data analysis techniques, which fall under Machine Learning (T1).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the application of hybrid intelligence in optimizing resource allocation for advertisements. It mentions machine learning algorithms integrated with traditional optimization techniques. The study uses a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative methods. The findings highlight improvements in advertising effectiveness and resource allocation, particularly targeting specific demographics.\n\nLooking at the codebook, the main topics are Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), Behavioral Economics (T8), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10). \n\nFirst, I'll check for Machine Learning (T1). The abstract explicitly mentions machine learning algorithms and their integration with traditional optimization techniques. This is a clear indicator of the Machine Learning topic. The discussion of the hybrid framework and its effectiveness in resource allocation further supports this. I estimate that about 60% of the abstract is dedicated to this topic, with high confidence (4/5).\n\nNext, considering the context of resource allocation and advertising effectiveness, the study touches on how consumer behavior and market conditions affect resource allocation. While this relates to decision-making processes, it doesn't delve into the psychological or cognitive factors that Behavioral Economics (T8) typically involves. Therefore, I don't see enough evidence to classify this under T8.\n\nThe other topics like Sustainable Development (T7), Digital Security (T9), and Public Health (T10) don't seem relevant here. The abstract doesn't mention environmental factors, cybersecurity, or public health issues.\n\nFor subtopics under Machine Learning (T1), the abstract specifically uses machine learning algorithms, which fall under the broader category of Machine Learning. However, it doesn't mention any specific subtopics like Neural Networks or Supervised Learning. Therefore, I don't identify any subtopics in this case.\n\nIn summary, the primary topic is Machine Learning (T1) with a significant portion of the abstract dedicated to it. No subtopics are explicitly mentioned, and other topics from the codebook aren't applicable here.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 60,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses the application of machine learning algorithms within a hybrid intelligence framework for optimizing resource allocation in advertising.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the given abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the provided codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of a multimodal identity verification system in early childhood education settings. It mentions technologies like facial recognition, fingerprint scanning, and one-time password authentication. The study evaluates the system's effectiveness in preventing unauthorized access, comparing it to traditional password-based methods. The results highlight improvements in security and efficiency.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics. \n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Digital Security (T9) because the abstract focuses on identity verification, authentication methods, and system security. The technologies mentioned are directly related to cybersecurity and authentication, which are subtopics under T9. The proportion of the abstract dealing with Digital Security is quite high, maybe around 70%, as most of the content revolves around the system's design, testing, and results.\n\nNext, there's a mention of experimental design and usability, which touches on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, HCI isn't listed in the codebook provided. The closest related topic might be Behavioral Economics (T8), but the abstract doesn't discuss decision-making, cognitive biases, or similar aspects. Therefore, I don't think T8 is applicable here. The remaining 30% of the abstract could be considered as not falling under the provided codebook topics, but since the codebook doesn't include HCI, I'll note that as 'Other' with a lower confidence.\n\nFor subtopics under Digital Security (T9), the abstract specifically mentions Authentication Methods and Threat Detection. The system uses multiple authentication methods, and the study evaluates its effectiveness against threats like unauthorized access. These subtopics are clearly present, so I'll assign high confidence to both.\n\nI should ensure that I'm not conflating topics with subtopics. The main focus is on Digital Security, and within that, the subtopics are about the specific methods and threat detection. There's no mention of other topics like Machine Learning, Sustainable Development, etc., so they can be excluded.\n\nIn summary, the analysis points to Digital Security as the primary topic with significant coverage, and the subtopics Authentication Methods and Threat Detection as the key areas within that topic. The other aspects of the abstract don't fit into the provided codebook topics, so they're categorized under 'Other' with lower confidence.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T9\",\n      \"proportion\": 70,\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"Other\",\n      \"proportion\": 30,\n      \"confidence\": 2\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Authentication Methods\",\n      \"confidence\": 5\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Threat Detection\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract primarily discusses identity verification systems and authentication methods, which fall under Digital Security (T9).

Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the safeguarding of personal identity in childcare settings, focusing on the effectiveness of various authentication methods. It mentions biometric authentication, multi-factor authentication, and behavioral-based authentication. The study's results highlight the success rates of these methods and their impact on reducing identity verification time. It also emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach involving fields like computer science, psychology, and education.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the main topic seems to be Digital Security (T9) because the abstract is about protecting personal identity through authentication methods, which falls under digital security. The subtopics mentioned are authentication methods, specifically biometric, multi-factor, and behavioral-based, which are all part of the Authentication Methods subtopic under T9.\n\nNext, the abstract mentions a multidisciplinary approach involving psychology and education. This touches on Behavioral Economics (T8), as it relates to decision-making and human behavior in the context of security. The subtopic here would be Decision Making, as the study involves how different methods affect the process of verifying identities.\n\nI don't see any mention of Machine Learning (T1), Sustainable Development (T7), or Public Health (T10) in the abstract. The focus is solely on authentication methods and their effectiveness, which ties back to Digital Security and Behavioral Economics.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: The majority of the abstract is about authentication methods and their evaluation, which is under Digital Security. This likely takes up about 70% of the content. The discussion about the multidisciplinary approach and the behavioral aspects takes up the remaining 30%, which relates to Behavioral Economics.\n\nFor confidence, I'm very certain about Digital Security (T9) and its subtopic Authentication Methods. The connection to Behavioral Economics (T8) is a bit less direct but still relevant, so my confidence is high but slightly lower.\n\nI should structure the JSON accordingly, listing the topics with their proportions and confidence, followed by the subtopics and their confidence levels. The disambiguation explanation should clarify why these topics were chosen over others, emphasizing the focus on authentication and the behavioral aspects.\n\nI need to ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted without any markdown or extra text, as per the instructions.

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I need to analyze the provided abstract and identify the relevant topics and subtopics based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract discusses the use of online platforms and how tailored interventions can promote informed decision-making. It mentions using advanced statistical models, integrating cognitive psychology and computational modeling, and employing machine-based algorithms. The study's findings suggest that cognitive biases and heuristics influence user decisions, leading to suboptimal outcomes. It also talks about designing online interventions, targeted messaging, personalized feedback, and implications for policymakers and technology developers.\n\nLooking at the codebook, I need to match these elements to the predefined topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract uses machine-based algorithms, which fall under Machine Learning (T1). The discussion of statistical models and computational modeling also ties into this topic. The subtopics under T1 include Supervised Learning, but the abstract doesn't specify the type of learning used, so I'm less confident about that.\n\nNext, the study's focus on decision-making influenced by cognitive biases and heuristics points to Behavioral Economics (T8). The subtopics here include Cognitive Biases, which is explicitly mentioned, so that's a strong match.\n\nThe abstract also discusses the design of online interventions and their impact on decision-making, which relates to Public Health (T10). The subtopics under T10 include Health Promotion and Disease Prevention, but the abstract doesn't explicitly mention health-related outcomes, so my confidence is lower here.\n\nI don't see any mention of Sustainable Development (T7) or Digital Security (T9) in the abstract, so those can be excluded.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions: Machine Learning seems to be a significant part, especially with the use of algorithms and models. Behavioral Economics is also prominent due to the focus on cognitive biases. Public Health is mentioned but less prominently, so it gets a smaller proportion.\n\nFor subtopics, Cognitive Biases is clearly present. Supervised Learning is a possibility but not explicitly stated, so confidence is lower. Health Promotion and Disease Prevention are related but not directly addressed, so confidence is moderate.\n\nI need to ensure that I'm not overstepping the evidence provided. The abstract doesn't mention specific methodologies beyond machine-based algorithms, so I shouldn't assume more detailed subtopics without explicit evidence.\n\nIn summary, the main topics are Machine Learning, Behavioral Economics, and Public Health, with varying proportions. The subtopics include Cognitive Biases and possibly others, but I must be cautious not to overcode.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 40,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 35,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 25,\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Cognitive Biases\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Promotion\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Disease Prevention\",\n      \"confidence\": 3\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of machine-based algorithms (T1) and their application in understanding decision-making influenced by cognitive biases (T8).

    "raw_response": "<think>\nAlright, I'm trying to figure out how to code this abstract based on the given codebook. Let me start by reading the abstract carefully.\n\nThe abstract talks about user engagement on social media platforms. It mentions using artificial intelligence, epidemiology, and decision theory to develop a predictive model. They used a correlational approach with a dataset of 10,000 users. The model had a high R\u00b2 value, and they found that visual cues and content sentiment were significant predictors. They also mention incorporating past behavior as a predictor. The implications are for social media designers and public health initiatives.\n\nNow, looking at the codebook, I need to identify the topics and subtopics.\n\nFirst, the abstract uses artificial intelligence, which falls under Machine Learning (T1). They mention developing a predictive model, which is a common ML approach. So, T1 is definitely a topic here.\n\nNext, they mention epidemiology, which is part of Public Health (T10). The study's implications for public health are discussed, so T10 is another topic.\n\nThe abstract also uses decision theory, which is part of Behavioral Economics (T8). They discuss factors influencing user engagement, which relates to decision-making processes. So, T8 is another topic.\n\nNow, estimating the proportions. The abstract spends a good chunk discussing the predictive model (ML), so maybe 40%. Then, the implications for public health are significant, so 30%. Decision theory is mentioned in the context of the model, so 20%. The rest is about the study's setup and results, which don't clearly fall into another topic, so 10% unassigned.\n\nFor subtopics, under Machine Learning (T1), they used supervised learning (since they trained a model on a subset). So, Supervised Learning is a subtopic. Under Public Health (T10), they discuss health equity and health systems, so those are subtopics. Under Behavioral Economics (T8), they talk about decision-making, so Decision Making is a subtopic.\n\nI'm pretty confident about these identifications, so I'll rate them as 4 or 5.\n</think>\n\n```json\n{\n  \"topics\": [\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T1\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.4,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T10\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.3,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"T8\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.2,\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"topic_id\": \"Other\",\n      \"proportion\": 0.1,\n      \"confidence\": 1\n    }\n  ],\n  \"domains\": [\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Supervised Learning\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Equity\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Health Systems\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    },\n    {\n      \"subtopic_name\": \"Decision Making\",\n      \"confidence\": 4\n    }\n  ],\n  \"disambiguation_explanation\": \"The abstract discusses the use of artificial intelligence (Machine Learning - T1) in developing a predictive model for user engagement.
