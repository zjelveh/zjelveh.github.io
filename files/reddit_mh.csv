1,"Hey everyone,

It’ll probably help to check my post history quickly, but basically in recent weeks/months I’ve been feeling horrible guilt over ways I’ve acted and things I’ve done when I was younger as a teenager. I’ve posted about them here, spoke to my mum etc, but it just stays in my head and I can’t get rid of it. For one, I feel horribly guilty because of the idea I’ve hurt people and acted awfully to them, and also, selfishly, I’m scared for my actions essentially coming back to bite me (which wouldn’t be undeserved). Anyway, I hope people here might understand, that when you’re an anxious person things just seem to stick in your head more and are harder to move past, things such as guilt etc. Obviously, guilt is warranted in these circumstances, but it’s really plaguing me and stopping me from moving on and becoming a better person. I have an assessment and CBT booked for this and other reasons in the new year, but I was wondering if anyone else who struggles with anxious thoughts (I don’t want to say anxiety as I’m not officially diagnosed) and has felt this sort of guilt in the past could give me advice for moving past it in a constructive way, not necessarily forgetting it, but just allowing myself to actually focus on some other things. Thanks everyone.",Anxiety,How do I get rid of guilt and the ‘stickiness’ of it?,Early life,

TRIGGER WARNING: Gaslighting, Abuse, Self harm, Panic attacks.‼️‼️

Starting all the way from the begining.. In my first years of middle school I was super shy, I would barely talk, I didn’t think much of it and no one else did either. Then things like panic attacks and fear of judgement started creeping in. In class before a presentation or even just answering would make me shake uncontrollably, my teeth would click together. 
It was so bad that even my classmates would notice, it was super embarrassing. 

One time when I was telling a poem in front of the class, because that’s what schools make you do, my legs were so weak that after I finished it I crumbled to the ground, the teacher was kind of patient with me but still gave me a bad mark, even though it clearly wasn’t my fault. Another kid that had the same problem as me said it worse than me and got a better mark. Favoritism  I say, but I can’t blame her, the dude is so nice and likable.

An incident that I remember so vividly.. I’m sitting in class, the teacher isn’t there and everyone is talking, screaming. I keep trying to focus but I can’t. I can’t. I can’t. It physically hurt me, my neck stiffened, my eyes were about to start shedding tears, my fists were clenched deep into my hair. I wanted to scream. After a while the teacher came in and calmed everyone down, finally. 

My shaky days in school were the worst, before having to sing in front of the whole class, keep in mind I’m really bad at singing and there’s this one girl who is absolutely amazing at singing who judges everyone.. She’s sitting in the front, I  was shaking so much one girl sitting next to me looked at me funny and asked if I’m shaking. As if it wasn’t fucking obvious. The humiliation I felt was unreal.

Horribly there were even a panic attacks induced by simple texts. The girl who was in my previous mini story texted me, telling me she harms herself. I tried helping but she told me, I shit you not - “stop it, you’re the reason I’m going to cut myself even more” I was crying so much, so damn much. I thought talking to her would help, she wasn’t the first person to tell me about stuff like that, I didn’t help my cousin that told me before her so I thought maybe, just maybe I could do a good deed for once and help someone?.. As you can probably tell - It didn’t go very well.

The year after all of that - everything settled down. I wasn’t as scared, my heart would still pound faster when I had to present, say “here” or do tasks as mentioned before but it was way more tame. Everything was okay, I thought I was finally improving. Little did I know things would get a million times worse, not in school but at home.

Basically every day now I have either tiny or explosive panic attacks where I can just slighty breathe. I had one just before writing this post. The root of my meltdowns is not surprisingly - family. All they ever do is scream and shout, my sisters little kid that she gave to us because she didn’t want to take care of him always cries, cries and cries, my parents yell at him and smack him, making him scream even more. Holy fuck I’m about to fucking cry again. 

I’ve noticed I’m super sensitive to screaming, when ever I hear someone yelling in anger or screaming in general it makes me want to scream louder to block out the noise. Every time things get especially bad I can’t help but start harming myself in places I later regret, crying, screaming or breaking stuff. I can’t help but think I’m weak, afterall, my sister had to go through all of this, even worse than me, being punished by my parents not only mentally but also physically.

Once my sister was getting repeatedly smacked with a broom, us having to share a room I could hear everything, I was so little, my sister even said she’d kill herself, my mother with no hesitation grabbed a knife from the kitchen and stomped back into our room, yelling for her to do it. 

I don’t know if I’m sensitive to yelling because of ptsd or something but I quite literally can’t take it. I try to calm down but the build up in my throat is too much, It hurts so much if I don’t do anything. Many, many times I’ve been told by my parents that they think I’m sick, I have a god complex, I only care about myself, I need mental help, I need to be sent to an insane asylum or what not. That shit fucking hurts since I know it’s their fault I’m the way I am. The time my mother saw my completely fucked arms, by that I mean cut up.. It was terrifying. She was screaming at me so much.. I tried jumbling up lies about what happened, I should’t have been so carefree, I should have covered them up. 

If you were wondering, no it’s not just my parents who are that horrible. It’s also my whole family line! Since my father’s half of the family is all dead I’m only going to speak about my mother’s. My grandpa has anger management issues my cousin, my mom, my aunt, even his wife, he’s too old and sickly to do anything now. My grandma has anger management issues but I guess she isn’t too bad when you’re obedient. My aunt also has anger management issues (starting to see a pattern yet?), is an extreme hypocrite, can be kinda cool but that’s only if she’s in a really good mood, if not, you’re going down into hell with her, whether you want it or not. The only chill people in my family are my cousin and my uncle, they’re cool. 

If you read all of this - thank you so much.
So yeah I basically told half my life on this app.. Can someone tell me what the hell to do? No “move out”, “call child services” shit cuz I’m not doing that. But please, I just need advice, I can’t keep on going like this, since covid is roaming in the streets I can’t even go outside to cool off.",Anxiety,What should I do?,Early life,

1,"Quick background of me. Im 18 and a male.  In my early childhood  there were personal things going on between my parents which i think started my attacks. Anyways i had major panic attacks all starting at the age of 8 up to the age of 13.  For some odd reason i had a brief few years after that where all my problems went away and it was great.  But then my graduating year of highschool it came back.... and it came back stronger then ever.  Around the start of 2020 just a month or two before covid became a big problem i had one panic attack in class.   And then it happened again. And again. And again.  And just from one single attack i ended up leaving school (dont worry. I ended up graduating online.)   My attacks had become way worse then anything compared to when i was younger.  It got so bad that because i constantly had a nervous stomach i stopped eating and i lost 40 pounds and became malnurished and basically looked like i was terminally ill.  On top of all this a global pandemic hit.  Great -_-     Honestly my attacks were so bad that i didnt even care about anything that was going on in the outside world so yea. Anyways i feel like im babbling on. So luckily since january of 2020 when my attacks restarted  and up until now almost being 2021 ive gotten put on prozac and i have had a foundation laid for me.  I managed to get a job at a lumber yard and now seem like a totally 100% better version of myself compared to the beginning of this year.

1,"Just want to preface that I understand everyone has unique life journeys and some are more lucky than others - I just want to know if anyone else shares this sentiment - thank you for any feedback. 

I feel like my experience growing up could have easily contributed to me growing up anxious af - however - I think those experiences instead helped shape me into the resilient individual who I am today. This will be written as short and sweet as possible to convey this idea I would like to discuss. 

I grew up as a low income immigrant - I was overweight until about 14 and was constantly bullied for it in grade school and in my neighborhood - I got beat up in the neighborhood and verbally abused at school. My dad used to beat me as a child for not keeping the house clean. I also had neighborhood “friends” who embraced hip/hop and rap culture (90s rap) who constantly instilled in me that I had to be “tougher” because that’s what the music told us. Essentially - these experiences are probably not what you would recommend to someone dealing with anxiety - I could have resulted as someone being extremely anxious about people and the world. I have a lot of reasons to be upset at the world and these are just a few examples I wanted to highlight quickly. 

I don’t think you should get bullied to help develop your mental fortitude - I don’t think you should get beat by your parents to make you more resilient - I also don’t think you should embrace toxic gangster rap culture as a solution to being socially anxious. 

However - I can’t help but feel like these experiences have set me a part from my peers in a way that helps me remain resilient through tough situations. I’m not trying to say that I’m better because of these experiences, but I’m wondering if anyone else feels like their experiences could have broken their spirit but instead built them up. 

Do you feel like your experience isn’t something you would recommend to someone else dealing with anxiety but is something you identify with as helping you remain level headed in tough situations? 

TLDR: I was bullied as a kid for being overweight, I was sometimes beat by my Dad as a child, I was influenced by my environment to embrace a “tough” mentality through hip hop/rap culture. I think these experiences have helped prepare me for the other hardships of life - but they could easily have been the things that brought me down.

1,"Hello everyone, 

I've recently noticed while doing some self reflection that almost the majority of my anxiety, fear and tension which is chronic at this point is manifested physically in my back, neck and shoulders.

I've had a stressful childhood and young adulthood. stress and fear have been my lifelong inseparable friends and that was just a matter of poor luck and shitty circumstance.

But now that I'm aware of all of that, I'm not much affected by the shitty circumstance... 

And was wondering if there's a quick way to get rid of the physical feeling of fear and tension in my back, it seems really silly and self imposed but I don't really know how to alleviate the fear out of my fucking back. 

I feel like if I could just get the physical feeling to go away, my mental state would get so much better... it would make the anxiety and fear more tolerable.

My parents moved out of state to be near my brother and this was my first Christmas without them (not to mention with COVID and me being an essential worker anyway). I’ve always felt that my parents favored my brother over me. I finally broke down crying last night after my mom texted me to ask me to get on our family Zoom because my dad “accidentally forgot to text me the code.” 

I have deep issues from childhood that I need to work through. At a pretty young age (about 7), my dad started referring to me as “lazy” and “careless” anytime I didn’t want to do something he wanted me to (mainly playing sports when I wasn’t very interested in them or good at them). 

Of course, my brother was a star athlete, so he won my dad’s attention and favoritism just by playing sports. I got into a good college, got an advanced degree and work in a helping profession. I have run several long distance races while raising money for charity. I have a good husband and two shelter pets. No accomplishment makes me feel good. I still feel rejected and empty. 

I feel even more triggered right now with the holidays. I have gained about 5 lbs (I’m skinny anyway so it shouldn’t really matter), but with the weight gain I’m reliving all the times my brother called me a “fat cow” when I was an overweight child. Today, my husband wouldn’t stop criticizing my driving in the car. It brought me back to when my dad tried to teach me to drive and was so critical and made me so anxious the entire time I nearly caused an accident. I’m now angry with my husband (I still believe he was in the wrong), but I wish I wasn’t so upset. 

I grew up in a family with plenty of money and opportunities, so I often feel like my struggles aren’t valid. But here I am, almost 30 years old, resenting my family for the way they have treated me over the years. Every time I bring up how I feel, I end up crying and feel like I’m gaslit into looking like the “crazy” or “spoiled” sibling because my brother and parents usually remain calm. As a result of my life experiences and brain chemistry, I have diagnoses of anxiety, OCD, and moderate depression. The OCD is paralyzing and makes my day to day like exhausting.

I seriously don't know what to do. My boyfriend didn't have a very easy childhood, I don't want to disclose too much, but he was abused in more than one way. As a teenager he got into drugs and witnessed more than a kid his age should witness. As a result of all this, he has a depression, among other things, but the depression is the more severe ""side effect"" . 

During winter, his depression gets worse. It's the anniversary for a lot of his trauma, it's Christmas, and we live in a country where the sun barely shines during winter. He is trying to get help, but his doctor is lazy, so it's taking way longer than it should for him to refer my boyfriend to a psychiatrist or therapist.

I have anxiety. I have developed it through my childhood and teen years as a result of years and years of harassment and bullying. It all came crashing down in high school, where I was diagnosed with a chronic illness and ADHD within the same month. I also got bullied and developed chronic stress. As a result I have social anxiety and general anxiety, and when I'm at my worst, my stress starts coming back.

Right now I'm not home with my boyfriend. He doesn't celebrate Christmas as a result of childhood trauma, so I'm with my family (we all got tested before getting together for the holidays).

My boyfriend's condition is really bad right now. He doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, and yesterday we had an argument because he thinks I'm too messy, and he was cleaning the apartment (even though I'd told him he could wait until I come home on the 27th). He's still mad, no matter what I do or say.

To make things worse, his best friend just cancelled our new years party (we were supposed to be 4 people), and now he seems even more down. He has known his best friend longer than he has known me. They're like brothers, so it was obviously a big let down when he cancelled.

When I was a kid, my brother was constantly angry, yelling, throwing tantrums, and being generally nasty/mean toward me and one of my parents. He basically ruined my childhood, and I'm still scared of him. Now, I've been getting mad and ranting over really stupid stuff. Like, someone almost broke my supplies, but it was an honest mistake on their part (they were actually trying to help me), and I was able to fix them. Instead of accepting it like a logical person would, I started yelling about how upset I was. Then, after, I felt so ashamed that I got mad enough to yell over basically nothing. I didn't yell at the person who did it, but I yelled about how stupid it was to the other person in the room. I never actually do this long rant toward the person who makes me mad when this happens (probably because I'll feel bad if I see their face and that will stop me from cussing + I'm afraid of confrontation). But then, that just stresses out the person I'm talking to (and makes them feel like I may get mad at them too), and I feel awkward and ashamed around the person I was mad at in the first place even though they never heard my rant.

I struggle with pretty bad generalized and social anxiety and it’s definitely related to my childhood. I am in therapy but it hasn’t helped me figure out how to cope with the anxiety I feel around social encounters. 

What happened: Last night I was going for a walk with my roommate and a guy walking his dog stopped us to ask if we were from town. We said yes and he asked if we knew of a safer place to walk because where he was coming from had “a lot of Natives around” (note that this is what I heard). We live in a country that likes to pretend it’s not racist but is and this is not the first time I have heard this. We live in an area where the Indigenous population is very integrated and people coming from other areas have commented on it. This is obviously a super bigoted comment and I got super prickly with him. My roommate was mostly silent during this conversation. I could see the guy was taken aback by how prickly I was, but he went his way and we went ours. It was then that my roommate said “I think he said ‘because there are a lot of needles on the ground’.” We live in a city and so this is an issue as it is in most other cities. I immediately felt like the biggest asshole and asked why he didn’t mention that before and he said he wasn’t sure that’s what the guy said (the guy was mumbling a bit). 

So I was a total asshole to this guy who was just looking for a safer place for his dog’s paws and I literally don’t know how to move on from this. I turned us around and tried to find him again so I could say sorry but didn’t find him. 

It has been ruminating in my thoughts ever since and I have an extremely difficult time letting go of situations like this. I was definitely in the wrong since I misheard what he said. I know logically I need to accept that I can’t change it and move on, but I don’t know how to do that. I now feel like I don’t ever want to go back into public because I apparently can’t even have a normal encounter with people.  Any advice or techniques that have worked for you, or literally anything is appreciated. 

Tl;dr: On a walk and encountered a guy walking his dog who I though asked “is there a safer place to walk, there are a lot of Natives around.” Got very prickly with him and afterwards my roommate said he thinks the guy said “...there are a lot of needles on the ground.” How do I quell the intense anxiety for misunderstanding him and being a jerk?",Anxiety,How to handle anxiety when you were in the wrong?,Early life,

Note 2: I don't think that anything in here is triggering?

When I was a little kid I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I remember being taken to lots of therapists and was eventually prescribed Lexapro, which I was essentially forced to take, and hated every second of it. I must have started taking it when I was maybe 8 years old, and made sure to convince my psych to take me off of it by the time I was legally allowed the rights to my own body (how insane is that?). I did everything that I could to convince him that I was fine, that I didn't have anxiety at all, etc. I finally stopped taking it at 14. 

Now, I need to mention that I'm female, now in my mid-20s. I haven't felt the need nor desire to take anxiety meds ever since I stopped as a teen. I think a massive factor that contributed to my anxiety was just dealing with my mom's unpredictable behaviors when I was little. She has PTSD from growing up with an alcoholic mother, absent father, and abusive stepfather. She also has anxiety and ADHD probably due to all of these things. I was an only child so as you can imagine, her emotional baggage was a lot for me to handle and something that I didn't fully understand until I became an adult. 

I was diagnosed with ADHD myself at 22, (I'm 25 now) when I was about to fail my thesis year of university. I've always had trouble finishing anything, visualizing time, and staying on task. The psych that I saw for this said that I was a classic case and that women are commonly underdiagnosed due to it presenting differently - we're a bit more prone to spacing out and being forgetful than our male counterparts who are more apt to bounce off of walls. She said that I was probably misdiagnosed with more severe anxiety than I actually had, and it could have been a mix of the two conditions, in turn aggravating all of the symptoms. I was prescribed Adderall IR and with it, I've been able to be productive ever since. I still have to work really hard at regulating my attention, but the medication helps.

I can say that I definitely haven't felt any significant anxiety ever since I moved out of my mom's house at 18.... until now. I don't know if what I'm feeling is an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder, but I think that it's all due to the stress of the pandemic. In terms of the actual illness, I don't want it, but that isn't what I'm worrying over. When the pandemic first hit, I was newlywed, overseas from my husband, waiting for my visa to go through. We were only supposed to be apart for two months, but it wound up being six. To top it all off, I was living at home with my parents, which brought up a lot of things that had been buried. That's when the anxiety started. 

It wasn't really constant worry. I was constantly depressed given the situation, but that was situational and I knew that I just had to be strong and handle it. Then one day, right before my husband came to my country to get me since it had been so long, I had my first ever panic attack. It was the weirdest thing. I didn't feel like I was having a heart attack or that I needed to go to the ER right away. I wasn't screaming or crying. It started with heart palpitations... but emotionally, I didn't feel panicked. I was working out one evening, I make sure that if I take Adderal, I do it in the morning so it wears off before I work out in the evening, so it was out of my system at that point. Of all things that I did to occupy myself and my mind during those hard months, exercise was my 'safe space'. It was an outlet. But one evening, on the treadmill, my heart felt really weird, like I was having palpitations, my left arm started hurting, and I felt like I was going to pass out. But I wasn't panicking. I stopped exercising and called the doctor the next morning who booked me an EKG for the next day.... it turned out normal. 

Once I knew that I was physically fine, I wasn't really worried about that, but my heart did still feel weird. I felt on edge. A few days later, just several days before my husband's flight, I absolutely could not sit still, focus, or calm down. I couldn't do my work, all I could do was pace. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't eat. I was worried about everything under the sun, ""what if the plane crashes?"", ""what if I fall down the stairs and die before I get to see my husband again,"" etc. etc. etc. to ridiculous and totally unrealistic levels.

I did everything that I could to regulate my emotions, deep breathing, yoga, exercise, meditation, lavender oil, but nothing stopped this feeling of absolute dread. I knew the fears were irrational but I couldn't get out of this downward spiral.

After three days of this, I called my GP and asked for anything, literally anything, to just help me get through the next 48 hours until my husband arrived because at that point I felt like I couldn't handle it on my own. I've never felt that way before. She prescribed me Ativan. Due to my childhood experience, I am very anti-meds. I didn't even like the idea of taking Adderall but appreciate the flexibility to decide if I want to take it or not on any given day. The Ativan did help, a lot, it kind of just ended the spiral and after two days of taking it, I felt a lot better and stopped. 

My husband did arrive safely, by the way, I did get my visa, and we packed up my things and went back overseas together. That's when the panic set back in. The day before we left and the day we traveled I was overwhelmed with dread, but not the same degree that I felt the first time. I tried to deal with it myself on day one, but did take the medication the day that we left in order to cope. 

I'm being hard on myself but I do have to acknowledge that these are extraordinary times, and my circumstances were very stressful. Being newly married and apart during an unprecedented global event, moving overseas during it all, etc. That's not your normal every day, and when I frame things that way, I handled it all arguably well.

I've been situated in the new country for four months now and haven't even felt the need to take the Ativan again... until the other day. Since getting here I've faced a decent amount of stressful things, moving out of the city when things got bad, searching for a job, knowing that I won't be able to see my family for Christmas, or for a while for that matter, adjusting etc. However, none of those stressful things or events actually set me off when it comes to this overwhelming dread. It just happens, preceded by a few nights of waking up in the middle of the night but otherwise feeling fine. Then there's the onset of the spiral where I just start worrying about everything under the sun, irrational, yet immobilizing thoughts. Again, I didn't experience this level of it since I moved, the level that I actually can't get under control on my own. 

Except for yesterday. The signs were clear, I was consistently waking up in the middle of the night for the past week, but otherwise feeling fine, I was actually in a good mood the day before it happened. However, that evening I just started feeling really overwhelmed. Yesterday morning I just felt utter dread. I exercised, listened to some meditation tapes, but still couldn't get it under control. I took an Ativan, and within 20 minutes the feeling of dread was irradicated. That evening and now, the following day, I feel normal. I think that I would still be in that spiral if I hadn't taken in, but I think this medication helps to just get me out of that spiral and to reset. 

I'm in the process of registering with a new GP over here and getting my ADHD medication sorted out, but due to this panic being a reoccurring thing, I want to talk to them about potentially getting something for it. However, I really, really don't want to be prescribed a daily medication. The thing about the Ativan is that the effects seem to last several days... or more, not that the medication is still acting but it lurches me out of this downward spiral. I don't know that much but I don't think that this is a chronic condition that needs daily treatment, other than the general stress of the times, I feel totally fine and normal 99.9% of the time. These panic episodes don't come about in any predictable cycle either. I've only had three. They're a very specific feeling too, not something that makes me go ""I wonder if that's what this is""... now that I know what it feels like, I know exactly when one is happening. I hesitate to call it a 'panic attack' either because I've read about them, seen my friends have them, and I'm not experiencing that ""heart attack"" or emergent feeling. It isn't really a moment. It's an episode that spans over a few days... and I don't actively panic, I don't scream and cry... it almost feels more like shock, I just get really quiet and can't really focus on anything outside of whatever ridiculous worries are going through my mind, but it's so overwhelming that I can't focus or dig myself out of it using healthy strategies that would normally take me out of a bad mood.

While I don't want to be on medications and definitely not *multiple* medications. I've realized that having it available might be, at least, a good safety net for if this happens again... which... I wouldn't say is outside of the realms of possibility. How can I speak to my new GP about this and specify that I really, really don't want to be on a daily pill and that I just want something short-acting that I can take only if I really, really need it?

Can anyone else relate to this? Is it situational and just due to the fact that we're living through really strange times? Is there something wrong with me? Is there a name for this 'panic episode' so that I could learn more about it? Is it PTSD?",Anxiety,"I think I started having 'panic episodes' this year, what's wrong with me?

1,"Hi, so kind of a long story but I'll make it as short as i can lol...

to start off I've had anxiety since I was 6 or 7 maybe and wasn't properly diagnosed till I was 14, I'm now 18 and have never been worse in my life. My mom and dad divorced 2 days before Christmas day when I was 12 and because my dad was the owner of the house he kicked me and my mom out and we had to go to my grandmas for Christmas with all our stuff in the car... at the time my dad was working in Saudi Arabia which was taking a toll on him I think because he wanted to be home and got angry easily while he was there. After 2 or 3years my mom met a guy and after which they started dating which I hated because I didn't trust him and he proposed to my mom after 11 months of them knowing each other (I know, WHAT THE F\*\*\*???) my mom stupidly said yes even though he had abused her before and continued to till they spilt up last year which the divorce hasn't been able to take place because of the current situation.

the guy used to be in the army and had clearly seen some shit because he'd randomly start screaming in the night which scared the hell out of me enough. he was also clearly an alcoholic, he'd hide whiskey bottles in a freezer we had in the garage and he would be VERY drunk every night of the week which is not a good combination because he used to abuse my mom physically and mentally too. there's been multiple occasions when he's kicked down doors in the house that my mom locked to get away from him while I would hide under my bed on the phone to the cops (I know I should of done something to stop him but the amount of fear that rushed through my body was insane and I felt like I couldn't move a muscle, I also wasn't about to go fight an ex soldier when I was a scrawny 15 year old without getting some bones broken so I stayed under my bed and spoke to cops instead) after these multiple incidents every time the cops came my mom would say he didn't abuse her so he didn't get arrested and even one time because he was drunk the cops told me and my mom to leave OUR OWN HOUSE and stay in a hotel!!!!

That is just one of the many many many stories by the way... So fast forward to now, I have been talking to my therapist about the things that went on and how I felt and she thinks that I have suffered traumas from all the events of him because I know struggle to go to sleep, I feel like has always watching me or following me around, even as I'm typing this I see a red car across the street where a guy has been sitting in there for at least an hour doing nothing which is really freaking me out. i also have a lot of nightmares about stuff has done and constantly wake up in the night. I also kind of blame my mom in a way for constantly forgiving stuff that he's done to me and her, she only now really understands what I have to deal with on a daily basis and is constantly seeing if am ok and if I need anything (being really supportive basically)

essentially if anyone has read this far what I'm asking is: does it get better? will this go away? I cant deal with the constant fear and tiredness because I only get a few hours sleep and thoughts that he's trying to break in to hurt me and my mom...",Anxiety,Throwaway account because im embarrased,Early life,
1,"Hi all, although I frequent Reddit I’ve never had an account so I made one because I felt like this post is important. 

Sparing the details, I can link the my depression to a specific month about two and a half years ago, just after my first year of university. At its peak, I remember spending at least 80% of my day stressed about how I felt, evaluating my emotions quite problematically, and at some point compulsively reading posts just like this to validate that “some day I was going to be okay”. (If you do that consider stopping it was definitely a crutch for me). It was really this notion of being okay that haunted me because it felt impossible, and doing what I was doing ensured that it was. I remember days where I thought I would be happier dead. I lived with this for over 2 years.

About two months ago I confided in a close friend and had a good cry, they weren’t really able to do much but offer support. I promised myself I would never tell anyone about it (I guess that made it real) and one day I just snapped mid conversation and let it all out. I understand that this is not a solution for everyone, and quite frankly it wasn’t that which sparked my feeling better, it was finally accepting that what I am feeling is okay, it’s allowed, and I’m not crazy, just a little anxious.

Looking back, it took about a month still to fully accept myself for who I am, sad feelings and all, and then that next month to finally be able to look back at those feelings from a distanced and rational place. The minute I stopped shaming myself for feeling this way, and for not immediately feeling better each time I tried something I was able to overcome those overwhelming thoughts. 

“A watched lawn doesn’t grow” 

I understand that what worked from me and what made me feel better will not work for most people, but I beg of you to at the very least head my advice. Please understand that you are not alone, there is nothing wrong with you, and I promise, one day you WILL wake up not “feeling better”, but not even thinking about it. That can’t happen if you observe every ounce of happiness and try to squeeze meaning out meaningless things. Please know that you are loved and this isn’t the end of the world, I promise.",depression,"It’s going to get worse before it gets better, and it does get better",Early life,

1,"Hi all, 

I am confused and worried about my younger sister, who seems to not really be developing in life at all. She has no career ambitions, no ambitions to do anything, and no hobbies whatsoever (except one that I’ll discuss).

As a 21 year old, I feel that she should be in the phase of her life where she’s exploring herself and the world, going out with friends, etc. the problem is that she has no fiends. She hasn’t had any friends since high school. I remember her as a child being so happy and outgoing. Now she’s very to herself, and she has some very bad habits.

For one thing, she’s very overweight. She just seems to love food and really eats a lot. It’s obviously a problem, but she’s not doing anything about it. I don’t even know if she wants to do anything about it. 

Another thing is that she collects dolls and toys, which might be seen as a hobby and not really a problem, but she goes overboard. She has so many and buys more all the time. It seems almost like an addiction, besides the fact that it’s a little strange for someone her age to have so many dolls.

She is in college right now, but barely getting by. She chose a major that I don’t even think she’s interested in, she just chose it to get a degree. I tried to have a talk with her the other day about possible career choices, ambitions, things she finds fun or interesting. I got nothing. Absolutely nothing.
 I asked her if she would like to travel anywhere, she said it’s a waste of time and money. I asked her what she really might want to do for a career, she said she wouldn’t mind working at the Costco food court, which is perfectly fine, but I don’t think she really meant it. I really don’t think she’s interested in working at all.

Currently she is young and lives at home with parents. But I am worried about what her future will look like, and her mental state. She has been to a psychiatrist who prescribed her antidepressants, but after a month or two she didn’t want to take them anymore because of how they made her feel. She has not yet been to a therapist. 

One more thing, she had some sort of an episode a few months ago where she got extremely upset at my mother because she believed that my mother was covering up things that happened to her when she was very young. Things that really don’t seem to be true or make sense at all. Kind of like false memories. She’s not hearing voices or anything like that. We were worried she had schizophrenia or some other mental disorder, but the psychiatrist ruled that out.

I had to deal with so much shit, and for what? My family doesn't know what I go through and I don't know how they'll see me if they knew every pain and hardship I went through. Would they brush me off? Say they've had worse? That life is like that? I do not want these answers from them, as they said that to my brother lots of times. They think of me as sheltered and spoiled to the point where things I experience are the first time like recently getting blisters on my feet and being worried about it. They laugh at the idea that a woman should treat herself as a pregnant woman the moment she's sexually active. You know, stuff like that. 

So much childhood sexual abuse. I can't believe that I've experienced this shit since I turned 18. But I hate the idea of therapy and medication. I thought that I can fix myself, maybe I can, but I do not have the methods, tools, and answers to heal this pain. I'm so stressed. I'm so stressed my body hurts. My neck and upper back feels so tense and strained, no matter what I do it's back to its tense form. My face feels blank. I feel helpless, but I am offered help so many times. 

Why do I brush off other commenters? Everytime someone say ""I'm sorry you've experienced this"" I just brush it off until I'm broken down again? Am I really okay? Why am I having a crisis and making this post when I might be normal again in a few hours?

1,"My mom always tells this funny story about how I was a very adventurous baby, so as soon as I was big enough to climb out of my crib, I threw myself out of it and onto the floor. Hard. The next day they went out and got me a big girl bed so I couldn’t do that again (I have not purposefully flung myself off of my bed and to the ground since then, so big girl beds have been a success lol). 

Anyways that story about me throwing myself on the floor as a baby is relevant because I’ve recently learned that brain trauma and head injuries in childhood can lead to depression later in life. Guess who’s had depression for literally as long as I can remember, with no helpful treatments? (Me). For a long time I didn’t even realize I had depression, because I didn’t know that there was any different way to feel, it wasn’t until I got worse that I started to suspect anything. It’s weird to look back at my life and habits as a 3 year old, an 8 year old, a 12 year old, and know that the reason why I was the way I was, is because I’ve actually had depression all my life. I started looking for treatments in my teen years, and since then I’ve tired CBD oil, smoking and drinking, quitting smoking and drinking, therapy, meds, quitting meds, meditation, writing a journal, drinking lots of water, getting lots of sleep, and all kinds of other suggestions, but nothing has ever actually made me feel any better. 

I used to just think I was failing at treatments because I wasn’t trying hard enough, but if my depression is a result of a childhood head injury and not from another kind of cause, then the treatment plan would likely look very different. Instead of learning to live with it through therapy and mindfulness, or re balance the misfiring neurotransmitters through meds, then the real cure could have to do with finding ways to treat old brain injuries. During mental health profiling, nobody ever asks you if you’ve ever hit your head really hard, or if you’ve had any kind of head trauma, but that question might be helpful for people who haven’t been responding to traditional treatments. 

I never realized or considered that possibility when trying to look for the source of (and hopefully a cure for) my depression. It has just always been with me, and I fear it always will be. But his breakthrough of another possible cause, and another possible approach to treatment feels like an interesting avenue to explore with my doctor.",depression,Possible depression from childhood head injury,Early life,

1,"For some reason I find most of my happy memories in the past, when I was a young kid. Ever since I was 11, most things have changed. I lost most of my relatives efter a huge fight between my uncles. Since that day, I’ve never felt the same. One of my uncles hit my father, my grandpa and when he entered the RV my mother and I were hiding in I started crying and screaming - to the point where he was about to smash my face with his fist. 

Then, Corona happened and I’ve no longer had a place where I could be myself... and ventilate from my loving yet very religious mother.

1,"I have been generally unhappy for my entire twenties (26 now). I’m sort of an addict and I’ve let that ruin most of my romantic relationships. But I DONT want that to define me. I’m a college graduate, a professional and a fitness buff. But sometimes I struggle with the choices I make. I’m so depressed thinking about my actions. Here is a vent I made to my mom over text earlier:

Sometimes I wonder, am I bad guy? I've always thought that I wasn't because my heart and mind has been in the right place but sometimes my actions will say otherwise. I'm disappointed with how I was towards Atticus (girlfriends son) because you're right, that's not how you have raised me. Even worse, I constantly think about me as a little kid, and the relationship I had with you. I think preschool and kindergarten. I remember my first full day of 1st grade and I cried during reading time and I said I wanted to go home because I missed my mom. I think about how I wanted to take that away from a child (not just any child but a child of a person I was deeply in love with) and it makes me hate myself. I've cried over it a few times. I strive to know why I would do such a thing. I do remember getting better and deciding I want to step up and be as good to Atticus as uncle mick was to me, but I got caught up with stress, work, drugs and I wasn't able to fulfill what I wished to fulfill. 

For most of my life I have been plagued with loneliness. Even in all of my prior relationships and encounters with women, besides Gabrielle (my recent ex). When I was with Gabrielle I never felt lonely, even when we were apart. It should be no secret that I want a family of my own someday, shoot I wish I could start now. With Gabrielle I thought I had that. Gabrielle is a really good person and you don't know enough about our relationship to be able to say otherwise. Gabrielle gave me purpose in life. Why I treated her the way that I did Is a mystery to me. I have a hard time trying to understand. She's the first person I believe I was truly in love with and I don't think I was able to handle it. She intimidated me. Everything about her was perfect. To me she had no imperfections. She had insecurities that did cause troubles in our relationship but I don't believe I handled them properly. If only she knew what was in my heart and mind she would have never been insecure a single day that we were together. I loved this girl so much Mom you don't understand. 

I don't know why I choose to reject happiness. It was offered to me so blatantly. Everything I ever wanted fell into place. Whether it be a higher power or just happenstance I had it. But I ruined it. I ruined the hell out of it. I don't know when or how I will be able to forgive myself. That's a mistake that changes the trajectory of my whole life. I would have loved for Gabrielle to be the mother of my children. She was such an amazing person. I will never be able to search hard enough to figure out why my actions were so different than what was in my heart. 

So now I'm lost, in every way. I hate myself. I hate my past. I hate the position I'm in and the mistakes I've made. I'm just so severely depressed and I'm a wreck. To the point of not even feeling comfortable just.. being me.  I don't know what I need to do. Start a new life somewhere else?) I don't know. I guess I am getting what I deserve.

1,"I’m 39 , 2020 is almost over and I’ll be turning 40 next year. And I really wish this is the final year of my life.

Nothing brings me joy or happiness, I’ve been on antidepressants for 5 years now and I just feel like this is how life will be until someday when I don’t wake. When I was younger , I had friends, nice girls would want to date me, I had a social life and things to look forward to. Now there’s none of that, I’ve had awful date after awful date over the last couple of years, with the kind of girls that I would never consider “wife material”. At 39 I don’t want to date a 21 year old with daddy issues, or someone with 5 kids but that’s basically all that comes my way these days

I had a traumatic childhood which I’ve never really gotten over. No one knows the abuse I suffered, my parents think I was a quiet child but don’t know why. They assume I was just someone who loved books a little too much,  but they don’t know that books and video games were my escape.

When I look back at my life, I feel like I have tried my best and utterly failed. I’ve always been kind, even now I’m the kind of guy who talks to homeless people , I’ll buy them food and listen to them. I’m kind to my niece and nephew and their smiles are maybe one of the few times when I feel warm and alive. I can’t recall the last time I was a dick to anyone, heck even my best friend jokingly calls me “Jesus” for how selfless i am at times

Despite doing all the right things, I’m alone most of the time, I’m forced to work from home due to current circumstances, when I look ahead , the odds of ever marrying or becoming a father are pretty much nil.

1,"I don’t expect anyone to read this because 1) it’s way to long. 2) there’s more important things going on like people dying but it’s nice to be able to get it off my chest.

I’ve never really spoken about this to anyone so I’ve decided to just let it all out here since no one will know who I really am. It’s crazy to think that I’ve been struggling with depression since I was a kid. My cousins took advantage of me and my innocence. They molested me and threaten if I ever spoke up no one would believe me. One did things to me when I was only 5 another cousin when I was 8 and the last when I was 10. When I was 11 my grandma passed away from cancer and I could never cope with it and still can’t to this day. Then comes a different part of my life. I was going to start middle school/jr high with no friends bc I was bullied by my “friends” in elementary. At 14 I made friends with the wrong crowd and was taking ecstasy as a cry out for help. One time I had taken 5 pills and mix it with tequila ready to just end my life even tho I didn’t know that’s what I was doing. At the same time I began take those pills I was discovering my sexuality. I was at my rock bottom but I was able to pick myself up.

I tried so hard to make friends hs but for some reason everyone hated me. Maybe they knew about my drug addiction? Who knows. I was jumped my junior year and suspended from school for it. I met my first gf ever and I was happy for the first time in a long time or so I thought. She cheated on me and verbally and physically abused me. I tried to dead my life again but didn’t succeed. I graduated hs and my family was so proud of me but I saw myself as a failure. I tried to go to college and took a few classes but the fear of not being able to make friends and feeling alone scared me too much so I dropped out and disappointment my parents. 

I started working and thought everything was going well for me but then I started drinking every single night in my room by myself. I then started working in a theme park and made a few friends working there and even found someone I fell for. She was out and wanted to keep it a secret and which is exactly what my first gf did and I agreed to it but then it started again. I was being manipulated and abused by her. She made me believe she was the only one there for me and my friends weren’t my friends but when my grandfather passed away she was nowhere to be found and my friends were there for me. The relationship was very toxic and we decided we were better off as friends with benefits but even then she was horrible to me. One night she told me I made the relationship up in my head and what we had never happened. That’s when I knew it was time to ended everything. She made me feel like I was going crazy and I was drinking a lot more and tried to kill myself again but I couldn’t do it bc I thought about me causing my family so much pain.

Months later I download tinder and met someone and we just clicked. I fell so hard for her and then I drove out to see her almost 2hrs away from my place. I was so happy but I knew in order for it to work one of us had to move so I decided I would do it and so I did. I left everything behind and I was depressed again. All the friends I had made stopped talking to me I had no one at here and I was having a hard time getting a job. She was able to get me a job where she work but I wasn’t happy. I got a job somewhere else and I was so happy. I thought I would be able to make friends in this city but I was wrong. I was treated (still am) like an outsider. No one made me feel welcomed instead they all judged me for being a lesbian and made little comments and gossiped behind my back even went as far as started a group chat to talk about me. 

And now we’re here. Im all alone and can’t talk to anyone about my problems because I feel like no one will understand me. I live in a city where I barely know how to get around and don’t have any friends I can run to for advice or just to hang out with. I wish I had someone I could talk to. I can’t even tell my gf or family anything because i don’t want to disappoint them or burden them. Sometimes I feel like i’ll be okay and then bam I think about everything I’ve been through in my life and how many times I tried to end my life and sometimes I wish I would have just done it so I wouldn’t here. I’m not happy and I’m not okay. Sometimes I’m so numb to everything. So if someone out there reads this I’m sorry.",depression,Why me?,Early life,
1,"I just feel like I’m so used to feeling so miserable and having days all the time that I forgot what happiness truly feels like; especially considering the fact my depression developed when I was 10 years old and  now. My therapist said to me today “Well, you may be confused as to what happiness truly is” meaning that the happiness of being innocent and not having to worry about you know, important things, may differ from what happiness is supposed to feel like now, considering the fact that I’m older and have been caring about things such as politics and social justice issues. She asked me “what do you think changed, after your parents got divorced” I thought about that and I’ve come to a somewhat conclusion: I realized how fragile life in general is. How relationships fall apart. How people die every single day. How if I choose to do something different EVER, I effect my future. I know that’s just how life works but it absolutely fucking sucks. Also, the realization that the world is a horrible place, filled with nothing but people who thrive for power and wealthiness. The realization even with the petitions we sign to aid that all of the horrible things that are actively happening, we can’t fix them. At the end of the day, I’m just a kid with internet. It just how the world works. Considering the fact I couldn’t even begin to tell all of my friends about this, it feels good to have someone to talk to. That’s another thing, although I have friends who love me, I feel so alone. All the time. No matter what I do. I would do ANYTHING to bring back that pure joy and innocence I felt a few years ago. I wish I wouldn’t have to look back at my teen years in the future and regret not “living them”. Life is terrifying. It’s as simple as that. And even though I will admit, I have some unrealistic expectations set for my teenage years, I know that crying myself to sleep every night and feeling misery every single day is not even CLOSE to what’s I consider a good use of them.

1,"Since it's my cake day, I thought I'd tell the story of how I began battling my most difficult depression spell. I'm on mobile right now, so please disregard any issues with this post.

I was diagnosed with depression when I was a kid, and I can honestly say it's one of the hardest things to deal with growing up and even now that I'm an adult. I used to go to therapy, but I didn't really see the benefit of it. For years, I would just wing it. Sonedays this worked, but a lot of days it didn't, but I persevered. In 2016, I began living with my alcoholic father in his one bedroom apartment. He'd drink a couple of fifths a night, piss his bed sometime while he was asleep, then wake up for work, take a few gulps from the bottle, and head out for work. At this time I wasn't working, so I'd be left inside the tiny apartment on the couch I'd sleep on, with only instant ramen noodles, and if I were lucky, some sandwich meat to eat. I was not in a good place, but again, I persevered. It was at this point that I met a woman that seemed to be like an angel to me, an escape from the shitty little apartment I was wasting away in. We began dating, I moved in with a friend, and I got a job. Things seemed to be looking up. About half a year into my relationship with this woman, I began to notice signs of her cheating on me. Once, I even caught her exchanging nudes with a girl at her college which was about to hours away from where I lived. Any time I had caught her doing something scandalous, she would cry and tell me how much she didn't want me to leave and how she would change. I forgave her any time she would cry because I felt bad for making her upset. After this, we began fighting more often, but no matter what we were fighting about, she would ultimately convince me that I was the cause of the fight, and I would accept it. This continued for 8 more months. Within these 8 months, I moved into my first apartment with three of my friends. The day we moved in was my birthday, and I was working hard to get all of out furniture into our new living arrangement. My girlfriend was incredibly upset because we were spending my birthday moving into my apartment instead of on a day long date like we would normally do while she was in town. At one point, I left her alone with my roommate so that I could go get a couch from the next city over. While I was gone, she slept with my roommate. When I got back, she seemed to be in a much better mood, but it didn't stop her from fighting with me more about how we didn't go on a date all day. So I finally caved, I took her out to get some ice cream, and we enjoyed that moment together. We came back home, she then presented me with my birthday present; some new sheets and a comforter for my bed. Then while we were settling down to sleep, we got into another fight. She ripped the sheets and the comforter from my bed, and proceed to take them to my closet where she made an area for herself in the floor to sleep. As always, I would apologize for the fight, and I eventually convince her to put the sheets back onto the bed so we could get some sleep. The fights began getting worse. One night I picked her up from work, and when I dropped her off at home, I told her we couldn't be together anymore. She then refused to get out of my car, so I got out so I could tell her family that we were over and that she was refusing to get out of my car. She didn't like this, so she got out of the car and began hitting me before I could get to her parent's front door. So here we are, in the driveway of her parent's home and she's continuously hitting me until I eventually calm her down, forgive her, and tell her we can give it another chance. At this point, my mental health was becoming too difficult of an issue for me to continue to ignore. So I took the path of self destruction to finally put an end to the relationship, and I did so by cheating on her with another woman. The next time we hung out, I confessed what I had done to her, and of course, she broke down in front of me, but then she forgave me and convinced me we could try again. I accepted, but the next time we fought, I just stopped talking to her for about a month. I remember the last time I talked to her, she wanted me to drive two hours to stay the night with her and I almost did, but I had finally convinced myself to stay away for good. She had convinced me that all the problems in our relationship were solely mine and mine alone, and I truly believed her. The woman that I cheated on her with wanted to be with me, as she had wanted since highschool and I felt obligated to give her a relationship. A few days into the relationship I realized that I didn't want to be with her, so I broke up with her one text and began to isolate myself. Eventually we kicked out the roommate that had slept with my ex, and I further began to isolate myself by cutting off connection with several people, and once I was finally alone, the gravity of everything came crashing down. The weight of my depression made it difficult to get out of bed most days, and I spent my time in my room thinking about killing myself, and how to prevent my other roommates from interfering. I was convinced that I was the sole reason for all of my misery, for my failed friendships and my relationship with this woman that did nothing but hurt me. In December of 2017, I deleted my social media, created a new Reddit account, changed my phone number, and I even started a new job. Getting away from social media helped clear my head a bit, but my self isolation continued and began to worsen. Two years later, my isolation was nearing it's conclusion, and I was preparing to kill myself. One day at work, I saw a woman outside I decided that I was going to strike up a conversation with her. I don't know where I got the courage to talk to her, but it felt like I was obligated to do it. While brief, we formed a slight connection, but it wouldn't be until a month or two later that it would finally take shape. She asked me out 6 times, and I either denied her because I didn't feel like I was good enough/ready for a relationship or I accepted her invitation for a date and then I would promptly cancel the same day due to the same anxiety of not being good enough/ready. I remember a night where she came over to hang out, and I was feeling really low, and after she left, I broke down in front of my friends and I told them that it wouldn't matter if I killed myself because they wouldn't consider checking on me until days later and that even if they did come to check up on me, I would have blocked the door with my dresser. This was my lowest point of this 3 year long, seemingly neverending nightmare that was my mental health. Eventually they calm me down enough to where they feel like they can leave me alone, and then one of them ended up convincing me to just dating this woman, and so I did. When we started dating, we were basically attached at the hip. I would always spend the night at her place, we would spend all day together, carpool to work, ect. You really couldn't separate us. During this time, she helped me work through my mental health issues and after several trying months, I finally broke free of the rut I had been trapped in. Ever since then, I still battle with my mental health, but now I wasn't alone. I finally had someone at my side who genuinely cared about my well-being. Now it's almost two years later, and I'm doing better than I have ever been since I was diagnosed. 

Tl;dr and what I learned:
After a very long depressive spell, I finally found the support I needed. 

What I learned from this is that not everyone is going to be there for you. Sometimes your parents won't help you, sometimes the people you think you have a genuine bond with aren't really the people you thought they were. I learned that social media is highly destructive to mental health, that even though someone is telling you constantly that you're wrong and you're telling yourself you're wrong that you were never really in the wrong to begin with. I learned that isolating yourself and ignoring the issue does a lot more damage then it helps. 

Most importantly, I learned that even when it seems like everyone has turned your back on you and that life seems hopeless, that you'll find the support you need and that there is a way out of the rut. 

I hope you all have a great day and that whoever is struggling finds their way out of the rut.",depression,"Three years ago, I began to fight a most difficult battle with depression.",Early life,

I immediately moved in with my father (who until 2 years prior was unaware of my existence). In the same year my sister was born 5 years my younger. My father was a victim of his own abuse, a father who would beat him, and torture him. He eventually ran away and started a new life. My father was around in my life but emotionally unavailable. Between K-12 I went to 9 different schools, and had 4 different step mothers. I had a sister, as mentioned, but she spent only the weekends with us. My childhood was mostly spent alone in my room trying to occupy myself. My dad was always too busy to talk to me. 

I guess my reason for verbalizing all this is realizing that I was depressed then and still am now. I don’t know if I’ve ever known was it was like not to be depressed. I feel like I ruin relationships with other people and with work because I always sink into depression again and become self-destructive. I’ve been trying to fake it for so long, I’ve almost had myself convince. It’s hard to maintain friendships, and relationships when you feel like you are drowning.

1,"How to deal with anger towards dad ( long post sorry)

So I’m a19yr old, who hates their dad. My dad was never really around growing up. He travel a lot for his job so he would usually be in town for a day or two at most. The only time where he would pay attention to me was when he grounded me or told me how dumb and useless I was. Anytime I would show emotion he would get angry. If I even shed one tear he would scream at me. I could never be around my mom when he was around. He would get furious if I tried getting her attention away from him. In my early teens years my dad started to get my mom to tag along with him while he travel leaving my brothers and I behind at home. Eventually my dad had to moved a few hrs away for work and my mom, older brother ,and I stay behind. At the same time my dad had promise my aunt that him and my mom would care for my two younger cousins for a year while they went to school here. But thing is that my dad realized he need my mom to go live with him bc he needed someone to cook and clean for him. So originally, plan was for my mom to look after my cousins and make sure they did well in school but it led to me doing that as a freshmen in high school. my older brother wasn’t around much bc he was a full time college student and employee.  So he wouldn’t check up on me or let alone my parents to make sure I was doing well in class or even if I was going to school at all. I had to do all the cleaning and cooking at home on top of taking care of those two kids. I almost never had time to sleep nor eat. I had to constant clean and cook food for everyone. Every time my parents visited us my dad would point out anything and everything I did or did not do correctly. I almost fail freshmen year bc I couldn’t keep up with school work. My dad made me drop out of softball and marching band bc he said those were unnecessary distractions and that I needed to be at home. I finally had enough with everything and had a breakdown and begging for my mom to come home and stay with me but my dad just told me how ungrateful and selfish I was. I was ruining everything for them. No one will ever want me with me if I had that attitude. My mom didn’t say a word to me for days. Since then I never complained about the situation. I bottle up all my emotions never letting anyone in. I started to develop severe anxiety and depression. After a while we all started to live together again but I soon realize my parents were only looking after my brothers. My parents never checked on me if I was doing well in school nor personally. Only time they talk to me was when i did something wrong or to tell me my brother was better than me. Fast forward to me being in college now being extremely independent from my parents, they are now trying to get involved in my personal life. My mom is a lot more welcoming and warm than she was in my younger years. Yet I constantly have to remind my dad about basic things he should already know bc his my parent. He doesn’t remember what college I go to let alone my major. He doesn’t remember that I’m vegetarian nor that I have food allergies. Literally he doesn’t remember the bare minimum. Yet he manages to remember every detail of my brothers childhood and such. It is a known fact between my parents that I have severe anxiety but my dad says I’m just acting out bc I’m a spoil brat. But at the same he drops everything for my brother whenever he shows any signs of distress. It is painfully obvious that my brother is my dad favorite while my other oldest brother is my moms. Which leads to me being left out all the time. I have so much anger built up from being emotionally abandoned from a young age to being constantly gaslighted, etc. I just don’t know how to deal with this anger that appears every time I’m near my dad. My old therapist said to me that maybe me being emotionally abandoned at a young age led me to become an independent adult and just maybe I should be thankful for it.

1,"Hi reddit friends,

There is something only few people know about. When I was a little child, maybe around 3 or 4 years old, my mother was hospitalized on a mental health clinic far away from the place where we lived. I stayed with my grandparents (her parents) but no one told me about what was happening. She was just gone. I think that as long as time passed I felt I would never see her again. Probably it lasted 2 or 3 months but for me it was like a year. The only thing I can remember is that my grandfather built me a swing and the day my mother arrived. I can't remember his face, I can't remember if she was similing at me or not. I can't remember if I felt joy or not. I only can slightly remember that she brought me a pink box with something inside (don't know what). I can only remember that pink little box and that she was on the main door arriving with bags and things. I can't remember nothing before or after that. I can't remember if she hugged me or kissed me or what she told me or if we moved inside, nothing... I think I only can see that I was in such a great pain.
It happens to me that I almost can't remember anything about my early childhood, like at age 8 or 9. I have very few memories and the ones I have are about pain. I suffered a lot during my childhood. My mother was depressed, I felt abandoned and not loved, sometimes she beated me for nothing, I suffered bullying at school, my mother had a violent boyfriend that beated me and her. Sometimes I came from school and I was alone at home. One time I was frozen by fear and pain because my mother didn't arrived at home until it was like 1 or 2 am. I felt like I would lose her forever.
As I grew up I also became depressed, probably I always felt a great pain inside me but my depression kicked me at age 16. Now I am 31, female and still struggling very hard with depression. I have been on lots of different types of therapy and meds and there is something inside me that is like just blocked /frozen and I can't even cry. I have no one to cry with too. My mother died at 2014 from suicide. My father died when I was 9 but never lived with him. I don't have any uncles/aunts or siblings. My grandparents are dead too. I had a great boyfriend but I`ve losed him because of my mental health problem. I feel that something is really stuck inside and feels like I still in a big deep pain that I try to overcome.

1,"I've always been tired, you know? I don't remember feeling happy; just always portrayed the facade everyone easily falls for, including myself. My life wasn't exactly the happiest, from being sexually harassed for years as a little child to witnessing my parents engage in domestic violence everything single day for the first twelve years of my life alone. Despite that, I did my best not to let it get to me. 


Then the bullying started. I was the passionate kid who loved to speak up about what was wrong and was proud of their identity as someone who hailed from a third world country that was persistently bombed. That reason, that lack of embarrassment about coming from such a nation it led to them calling me so many things. They dropped me from countless events and competitions knowing I was the best student from the class. They would lie about me to my parents, telling them I'm the bad influence in the class and how I'm getting other people on the wrong path. My mother would blame it all on me instead of ever defending me. I had to fight for myself, to defend my character and who I was. Almost as if that wasn't enough, my friends would call me derogatory terms while claiming to be my good friends; in their eyes, I was the refugee (despite being born here), I was fat, I was ugly, I was 'too manly' for a girl, I was the one to be blamed for in case something went wrong in friendships among themselves. I was the one who had to be at fault for everything. I was only twelve years old or younger when this happened. 


When I became thirteen, I developed passion for politics and humanity affiliated field. Looking into it, I realised there were people in places worse than mine; that's when I felt the insane urge to help and fight for them. This felt like life being blown into me. I had finally discovered a purpose to live. Like I wanted to dedicate my life helping people and fighting for their rights.I loved justice, I wanted to help the people who hailed from countries by providing them justice in humanitarian courts. I was so excited. I was so excited to finish high school and chase my dream. I started to study human rights law from the age of fifteen, educated myself on what to and what to not do. My life somehow got on track, I didn't care about the rest of the world despising my new nonchalant attitude, I didn't care about the bullying, I didn't care about anything but my future career. It was such a thrilling feeling, you know? To discover a purpose in life. I felt like I had a reason to continue living, not for myself because I never believed I existed for myself; God had made me for anyone but my own self. Finding this was so beautiful, so relieving, so happy. 


You see, my father is a man who values status above everything. When I turned 17 and the decision of me entering college came, he shouted his brains out when I told him I wanted to go for law. He said a bunch of misogynistic things about the field not being for women and whatnot. He told me I would never have a future in it. And that is when I got forced into medicine, a field I hated more than my very life. 

I got my passion stripped from me. The very thing that made me look forward to life. That singular thing which made me feel a shred of happiness, that thing I worked so hard for. I lost my purpose. 

But you know? I was still okay with it. I just wept about it for a month and told myself to get over it. It is what it is, right? By then, I had developed a strong insatiable obsession with existential nihilism, and that ideology helped me get over losing my dream, albeit in a very unhealthy way. At that time, I also got told I suffered from dysthymia and ADHD. So yahoo!! Fun, isn't it? 

You see, I despise the country I live in. I have no positive memory of being here, none. I hate it. I wanted to leave it, so I thought maybe if I work hard enough 2 years into pre-med and get enough decent grades, I'll be allowed to get into a university somewhere else. So yeah, I worked for it. 

Until today when I got told I'm supposed to finish my medicine in this country. That's another 8 years spent here, with these people, this society, this environment that despises me. 

I honestly can't do it. I genuinely can't. I have reached my point. My breaking point. I've always wanted to die, but I had always been too scared to go for it. I've always wanted to live, but I can't do that either. I feel like I'm living for the two people who have destroyed me and my sense of self-identity all to a point I don't know who I am. I can't run from here, it's impossible. I would've tried but I can't. My youth will go by but I'll be trapped, having to fake happiness just so that my mother and father do not mentally manipulate me and tell me things I CAN'T stand hearing. I can't do this. 

I could've been a bright kid.. Maybe an amazing person with so much to live for, but I am tired. I can't live anymore. It's too much. I'm tired. I'm so tired. I can't do this for another eight years. I've been fighting for so long, even when my own body wanted to give up. I have genuinely never once felt happy until I had found something I loved, but it got taken in the name of materialistic shit. I'm fucking tired. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of everything, I'm tired of being told I'm not studying hard, I'm tired of being told I am talentless, I'm tired of being compared to those kids who got into this field by will, I'm tired of being asked why I can't do well like them when I never wanted to do this to begin with.

Throwaway due to obvious reasons, I won't disclose any personal details besides the fact I'm 21 M. I'm getting CBT next year and for the mean time, I've been doing breathing techniques, listening to biaural soundtracks. Reading more. I also want to get into mediating more.

I had a chaotic childhood growing up: a deadbeat father who cheated on my mother and never paid child support, a half-brother and a depressed, heavily religious mom who physically and mentally abused me and brothers whom I suspect sexually molested me (i believe this is child-on-child sexual abuse but most of my childhood is blurry.) I also suspect a girl possibly took advantage of me during elementary school (this is also blurry.) We grew up in poverty and my mum became an excessive hoarder to the point I could never bring anyone over and my mum would often blame the mess on us. I grew up in fear of my mum and half-brother where violence, punishment, verbal abuse was rife in the house as a kid. I remember self-harming as early as I was eleven. Although now, we seem to be more normal and healthier, nobody ever brings up the past.

I endured a lot of bullying solely for the color of my skin during school and this messed up my self-esteem massively - where I became this toxic masculinity guy growing up along with friends who peer pressured me. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and wishing I was white sometimes.

I grew up depressed and confused about life, especially being a ""black poor man."" I wasn't eating, sleeping, washing myself or cleaning my room. I spend money recklessly. I'll self-harm quite a bit when I wanted to hurt myself in some capacity. I ruminate a lot about my future, I drown it all out by smoking too much weed or drinking too much. I rarely talk about my feelings unless it was in an unhealthy manner. I didn't know who I was so I spent a lot of time on the internet, specifically Twitter where people found me cool, funny and attractive. I saw the internet as real life because real life fucking sucked.

 I branded a personality and I de-attached myself from reality where I was this depressed loser piece of shit who worked at a fast food restaurant, didn't have any happy youthful memories or whatever. I used to be a misogynistic creepy pos to women, I lied about being a vegetarian when I used to secretly eat meat, I people-please, I lie about small things, I pretend that everything is fine. I ghost on people. I run away and hide and ruminate about how I'm a shitty person who is a fraud of a human. I wasn't emotionally stable enough for my ex-girlfriend, she showed me her world and I didn't because it meant looking at myself, my past self. I was cruel to her at times (never abused or did anything super-fucked up) but I said some mean things sometimes. Of course, I apologised but still She loved me so much and I didn't really know how to love her because I didn't know how to love myself and recieve love. I tried so hard though. She said I'm wasn't a shitty boyfriend and I believe I tried my best even though I hurt her feelings at times. She gave me the best memories of my life and I hate to think that she wasted her moments on someone like me.

After a failed suicide attempt two months ago and multiple breakdowns I've decided I need help. I spent too long pretending things are fine and that I'm fine when I'm not. I went counselling in June and it helped a bit. I need to sort myself out, I think I suffer from depression, anxiety, autism and probably some other shit too, I don't know but I hate my brain and I want to say it here: I put myself down so much because all of my life I have been put down. And I'm tired of it. I deserve to love myself, I deserve to recieve love from others and I want you guys to know, you do too. It's hard but when there's love around and you let absorb it without that voice in the back of your head telling you: You're not worthy of this because you're broken and you will always be.

I've made a lot of bad moves in my life and I judged myself for it, further putting me into that hole of depression - what if I went to this college and made new friends instead of spending so much time on Twitter talking to randos because they liked me or what if I didn't realise they were people who actually liked being with me in real life. What if I wasn't a creepy piece of shit and even thought I was a predator at one point. What if I got help earlier? However, I can acknowledge I've been a dickhead to people, even if I didn't have the intention to do so, I can't change the past - all I can do is make amends and be better to others in the future.

I'll always have depression in some form but I don't want it to have a chokehold on my life. I want to travel the world, I want to have a loving girlfriend and be a good father to my children. I want to go to festivals and do all sorts of cool shit. I want to graduate University and maybe even get a masters. I want to get a cat. I want to drive a car. I want to go to California, Morocco, Japan, Spain, Ghana, Canada etc. I want to live in integrity and treat the people in my life the way they deserve to be treated.

I'm currently 16 years old, turning 17 in January. I've been suffering with pretty severe social anxiety disorder since I started high school (age 13 in UK) which prevented me from expanding my friend group. in high school I was friends with people I have known since a very young age, and only 3ish people I met through high school, which were all terrible role models and made my mental health a lot worse, they were typical bullies thirsty for validation from peers and would all be horrible to each other behind each others back, the bullying wasn't limited to other people, it would happen in the friend group too.

 this all stopped when i finally got ""home-schooled"" when school discovered I had SAD, I've been getting ""home-schooled"" for about a year now. the home-schooling consisted of me being mailed work, which the school didn't even check if i completed or not. i haven't heard from my high school friend group since I left high school a year ago, none of them checked up one me once, 2 of them blocking me on social media. I always wished i could just be left alone and not have to associate with any of them, but being the anxious person i am i was always worried about being the ""outcast"" I guess you could say. I didn't want to be the one kid walking around alone at break.

Since then I've been so much happier alone, I've only got 2 ""friends"" right now, which both request favours from me but never return them, so essentially using me. I'm fine with this, as i barely make contact with them at this point. There was a period where i weren't friends with them for 8-9 months this year and i was perfectly fine, i had no problem with it. I see a lot of people especially on social media that crave a relationship in some way or another, always needing to be with friends, partying with others, you name it.

 I don't know if my situation is a good thing or not, I've never been a sociable person and spend my days inside on my computer, working (paid hobby, not really job), or just laying in bed, watching youtube or another source of entertainment. I don't know how to feel about this.

M 25

Working through childhood trauma and I thought it would be a good place to share my story and get some feedback. This is an abbreviated version and I may not have all the details, but I will give it a shot.

My life basically began with a nasty divorce between my parents. My mom got custody of myself and my two brothers and I never saw my dad after he left when I was 4. I always remembered my dad for how my mom described him, and she was always telling us to hate him and shunned us from speaking about him. 

Growing up I was always loyal to my mom. But she put myself and my brothers through a lot of emotional abuse. Lots of screaming and punishment for no apparent reason, so my home life was centered around not pissing off my mom.

From that divorce, I started having suicidal thoughts as a second grader. Social rejection from my peers on top of my parents separating made me feel unwanted, and I didn't want to be here anymore. When my teachers brought it up to my mom, she flipped the fuck out on me. Most of her rants were threats of child services coming and taking me away, and that our family would be destroyed if I didn't keep my mouth shut. She always said ""you'll be running your fucking mouth out of that court room."" She never brought me to a psychologist or psychiatrist. And I am pretty sure it was to avoid getting child services involved.

She always would threaten my brothers and I with abandonment. She always said she was leaving to another state and that we had to fend for ourselves. She would send us to our rooms and pretend like she was packing her things, get in her vehicle and drive off. When she left, my oldest brother would kick the shit out of me because it was my fault my mom left. 

So this lead to a lot of psychological problems and I have been suicidal for most of my life. I am not sure I know what real joy or love actually feels like, since it was always quickly followed by pain and guilt. 

Later in life I found out that my mom only married my dad so she could get money from his tribe (he is Native American, as am I). I wrote my dad during the pandemic last spring and found out that her intention on having myself and my brothers was so she could claim trust money that our tribe gives to enrolled children. She coerced myself and my brothers out of our tribal money saying she was ""investing in ***our*** future"". We all agreed to letting her use the money to purchase a permanent home, the investment made sense since we were tired of living in and out of rentals. But it was mostly because if we objected she would abandon us or threaten to kill herself. 

After all was said and done, I finally reflected on everything and realized that my own mother basically robbed my trust money. A borderline act of fraud premeditated at my birth. My trust in her is obliterated and it lead to me deciding to destroy my relationship with my mom.

This is my first holiday season alone. I am beyond done with my family. I am in disbelief that my own mother would sabotage my future for her own interests. She got what she wanted. That being said I do not love her. I was loyal to her for 24 years and she got her fucking shopping spree. 

If I am grateful for anything out of all of this, I am grateful for my tribe. They still have my back as a young adult and they have programs that are helping me finish college and get into a career. But all of this makes me sick.  

TLDR; Mother was emotionally abusive, threatened with abandonment throughout childhood, lived most of my live in fear of my mom while my oldest brother beat the shit out of me. I stayed silent about all of it and internalized my suicidal thoughts. Mother also used me for tribal trust money and deceived myself and my brothers into surrendering it to her. So my mom is a deceiving manipulative bitch and my whole life is a money driven lie created by my greedy mom.",depression,Abusive parent story,early life,
1,"This might be long so I apologize BUT you might find it interesting! Let me know your opinions.

When I was around 8 I had a very vivid experience of auditory hallucinations where I could hear two men screaming and arguing with each other over where to place a brick. I was wide awake and in my head I was picturing two construction workers arguing. Although I was picturing this image in my head, i could physically hear the shouts so much that I covered my ears with my hands and went “LALALALALA” to drown the sound out and when my brother asked what I was doing I was confused that he didn’t hear the men shouting. 

Around a year later, the same thing happened. This time I didn’t have any image in my head at all, but it was the same screaming male voice demanding that I pass him a pillow. I couldn’t actually picture him there in my room but somehow I understood that he was across the room bc I got angry at the yelling and I sat up in bed and threw my pillow across the room and then the screaming stopped. I did not recognize this voice as someone I knew, but I didn’t question it either and I was not scared either time. Well, the first time I was stressed out because the shouting was too much tbh but the second time I was just really annoyed that he was asking for a pillow and I wanted him to shut up.

Whats weird is that both of the times that this happened I was not confused as to what was happening like I didn’t question the screaming voices at all, as if it was a normal occurrence. The second time it happened I remember realizing what had just happened and feeling confused after the screaming stopped but nothing much came out of it. 

Both of the times this happened I was laying in bed at night to go to sleep but I 100% was not dreaming because my brother reacted to me reacting to the screams both times. I also was not drifting to sleep both times that this happened, I was just laying in bed but not yet tired. 
I’ve never had any other experience like this since then, and im still confused as to wtf that was.

English is not my native language, and I'm not too familiar with this subreddit, so I'm sorry if my formatting or anything is off. Also big, big, TW: mention of childhood abuse.

Also this got very long, so at the end is a TLDR, but I'd really appreciate it if you could read the whole thing, as it explains the problem a lot better.

About me, I am 22 years old, still in school, and in a relationship. I have diagnosed pre-existing conditions, but I am not sure if they are responsible for this problem I am experiencing. I am diagnosed with PTSD due to childhood abuse, and depression.

When I was around 16 I dropped out of school because of my problems, I just could not handle the tiniest bit of stress anymore at that point. Even just leaving my room became to much, to a point that my family had to leave me food in front of my door, leave and only then I could take it. I basically couldn't leave my room for almost three years. 

I got help then, by a woman that would come over once a week, and she'd basically slowly establish contact and would train me to leave my room again, slowly step by step. Eventually with her help I was able to enroll in a school that was basically to build me up to get back to a real normal school again. I got accepted by that school, and am now doing my best there.

But here is where my problem starts. I am not a psychologist, so I can not say it with certainty, but in those 3 years of total isolation, I would basically satisfy my social needs by imagining relationships with all these fictional characters I liked, imagining them being there, supporting me, or just talking to me. I feel like maybe this was some sort of self protection for my brain to at least pretend that I was with people. Over time it became so real. I'd cry if something would happen to them as if they were my real friends, I'd have ""relationships"" with some.

But having this need to have them as my companions meant I would spend literal weeks digging up ANYTHING and I mean anything about them. From everything canon to their story to fan created things, everything. Just so I could have as human of a relationship with the as possible. Any info not available I'd fill in myself. I probably knew all of them better than any real person ever. It got to a point that I'd have actual fights with them, moral or political disagreements. It was ridiculous.

I did something very similar as a small child too, when  I was neglected, or I was hurt, I'd imagine these characters helping or comforting me. I also have a very vivid imaginations, so if I concentrate I can literally ""see"" them in the room with me.

When ever I'm mentally well, they basically fade into the background. I can focus on and interact with people and life relatively normally. But whenever I start feeling lonely, or overly stressed I get sucked into this sort of bubble, every thing feels surreal, and dreamlike, except them, despite me knowing they are the ones who aren't real. 

It is extremely hard for me to interact with real life people, or leave my house in this state. I basically just have to hang in there, isolate myself and wait until they go away on their own. This state usually stays for about 2 days up to a week, and I feel totally helpless while it's happening. I know this must be some kind of maladaptive coping mechanism, either from childhood or from when I was isolated, but I have friends now, and even a partner. And now the thing that kept me sane once is getting in my way now.

One thing I want to really stress though is that at no point did I think they were real people, or actually there with me. Like I don't believe Finn from Adventure Time just magically materialised in my room or something XD

I know the best thing would be to get professional help, but I have been struggling with finding anyone. My family supports me and tried helping me find a therapist, but literally everywhere we call they can't take new patients, or only work with specific kinds of clients and so on. 

Any thoughts or tips would be greatly appreciated, and thank you for reading :)

TLDR
I'm a survivor of child abuse, and ever since then I'd imagine to interact with fictional characters to help me cope, when I was 16 I was isolated from basically everyone for 3 years which made this way worse. Now I do have a proper life with real friends and a relationship, but when ever I get lonely or stressed these characters come back into my life, and despite not wanting to I isolate myself again, until they ""leave"" again.",mentalhealth,I spiral into obsessions about factional characters to a point that it affects my life.,Early life,
1,"Some background info: 

I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, and self-harm since I was about 11, but since my parents don’t really believe in mental healthcare, I never saw a therapist until I was 17 and came out to them about my rape (which occurred when I was 16). My therapist has since diagnosed me with depression, anxiety, and PTSD. 

I have thought about getting medicated for many years, but I know that side effects can sometimes make the situation worse and that lifestyle changes can often be just as effective. And, of course, because of my home environment medication was not an option for me anyways.

But I’ve recently turned 18 and am wondering if there’s any way I can consult with a doctor or psychiatrist about the possibility of getting medicated without my parents finding out. I’m still on their healthcare, but I am in college and am not staying home during the semester. I’ve been trying as hard as I can to maintain a healthy lifestyle and to naturally manage my mental health, but it honestly feels impossible sometimes and I’m sick of constantly being passively suicidal. I know medication is not a quick fix, I just want to talk with a professional and see if it could possibly help my quality of life. How can I do this without them knowing?",mentalhealth,How do I go about getting medicated for mental illness as an 18 year old on my parent’s health insurance without them finding out?,Early life,
1,"I'm 25 and I've tried therapy a few times and never gotten past session 3 or so. Granted, my options until now have been slim- once was at my university's mental health services office and another was at a free Medicaid place staffed by masters or doctorial candidates. I've just had a hard time sitting down with someone and telling them what I want, sharing private parts of myself right away, or figuring out what to talk about first. 

Just as some quick background, I deal with some serious adult ADHD symptoms and mild depression, and would also be interested in working through some parental issues, some deep guilt/grief I have from some childhood events, and just generally processing through things better. 

In these early sessions I've had, I've had the person I'm with pinpoint-focus on something that I don't consider a huge problem and I don't know how to redirect, or just ask me point-blank first session what I'm there to talk about and stare at me smiling while I try to summarize all of the reasons I'm unhappy and stutter out some bs response. It feels like performance anxiety at times. I'm aware that a lot of this just comes with having many sessions, and that I'm not going to leave session 1 or 2 with my life solved. I just never know where to start! And the dread of having to be vulnerable on the spot and re-tread and validate like, the story of why my dad's a piece of garbage, to the sympathetic face of someone I just met is keeping me from really pursuing this further.

1,"Hello Everyone! 

This is my first time ever using Reddit so I’m not sure how it all works yet, so go easy on me please! 

I had a pretty hard childhood and I thought I’d share some of my experiences. 

I was ten years old when my mom had a complete mental breakdown, and I was there to witness the whole thing. My life changed forever on that day. It took years before she got a diagnosis (paranoid schizophrenic) and even after that, she still didn’t believe she was actually sick. I got taken out of my mom’s home and placed in my grandma’s home, whose wife is bi-polar. So moving from schizophrenia to bi-polar was not much of a relief for me at all. I spent four years living with my two grandmas while my mom suffered through the worst of her illness. She was sent to group homes, and hospitalized, and the male attention she was attracting was getting dangerous. It wasn’t until I was about 17 that my mom got stable on medication and came to terms with her illness. 

To top all of that off, my parents divorced when I was just a baby because my father has been addicted to meth since he was in high school and my mom couldn’t stick around and watch him screw up my life. My father has been in and out of jail my entire childhood and I can just about count on one hand how many times I’ve seen him in my life. 

It was a very traumatic childhood. 

If you’re interested in reading more about my life with all of that craziness and how I survived, I recently started a blog called Distressed and Distracted. Growing up, I never met anyone else who had a life like mine and I have felt so alone in the world for years. Now that I’m an adult, I wanted to share my story and hopefully help and connect with other people who have had a rough go at it too.

1,"I don’t even know how to say this concisely. I don’t know whether or not I’m exaggerating past events or if I’m overreacting. I don’t remember anything good from my childhood although I’m certain I was spoiled. My parents gave me whatever I wanted, and I know this as a fact because I have an insane collection of kid’s toys in the basement.
But I don’t remember any of that. All I remember are the times when I ‘disobeyed’ or ‘disrespected’ or ‘hurt his feelings’ and I was physically attacked or called insane. 
But it’s not as if being hit by a parent is uncommon in my community, although I doubt my high school friends had their parents punch them backwards down the stairs. 

Anyway, most of the physical stuff was about 4 or 5 years ago (I have a terrible memory), and although he still has outbursts of anger I’m confident he won’t ever hit me again. He stresses that he’s sacrificed a lot for me, and it’s true. My university tuition is expensive because I’m an international student, and he’s paying for all of it. He buys me gifts sometimes without me asking, and I’ve never felt deprived, materially speaking.

I needed closure about a month ago and I confronted him about the past. He refused to apologize and he became furious. He said that I had said things that hurt his feelings.

I'm going to therapy nearly every week, but during every visit I say that I'm doing fine. Why, you may ask? Because I'm afraid of being ""found out"". I feel like a fraud for feeling this awful, because I really have no reason to feel awful. I've never been diagnosed with anything and I doubt that I ever will be. Everybody feels down and nervous sometimes, right? So there's no way that I could be depressed or anxious, because I'm still functioning normally after all.

     About my parents being supportive...I really don't think they, nor my friends, really see how down I really am. When I first told my homeroom teacher about my self harm in middle school, who then contacted my parents, they were furious. No, they weren't concerned. They were angry that I was hurting myself, because in their minds my life is going just fine. This reminded me of the day when my mom read about Chester Bennington's suicide. She turned to me and said: ""At least he had an actually difficult childhood."" After this, I've never talked about any of my struggles with her, because obviously she didn't think that anything going on in my life was bad enough to warrant any sympathy from her. When I started going to therapy, and my dad had to go meet my therapist, I asked him what they talked about. He just snapped at me and said: ""It's pretty obvious why you're going there,"" clearly talking about my cutting. This confirmed that he didn't feel sympathy towards me either.

     I know this has just been a mess, but yeah, no matter how awful I feel, I don't think I deserve therapy.

Many memories haunt me. Being pelted by pinecones in my early years of school, being isolated and treated like a clown for a good part of my childhood while clinging to anyone I could, my father yelling and interrogating me every Saturday, being hit by a car and my leg being broken, the constant nights of crying myself to sleep, the nearly mentally breaking stress of freshman year that was the ultimate culmination of what I consider to be my depression, and the ultimate abandonment by my Dad's side of the family along with my father refusing to go halfsies on dental work.  


Some of these memories even cause me physical pain when I remember them. I am not suicidal by any stretch, nor do I self harm, but I feel if I died tomorrow the only thing I'd feel sad about is my mother's feelings. I feel barely grounded to reality, as if I am a ghost. I have no consistent friends online, no group, no people. IRL I only have 2 friends, and they have served me greatly throughout the years. Without them I would have probably kicked my own bucket before now.  


It feels like the past years have been nothing but a blur, a facade, a dream. I would not be surprised if this is only a cheap simulation, though the chances of it being so are quite unlikely and probably not the case.   


It's hard to describe my mental state. I can go from optimistic and full of courage to a shell of a human being in a few days. I feel as if someone is pressing at the back of my eyes and squeezing my heart. I feel depressed at times though I have no courage to actually see if I have it, for fear of not actually having it... If I don't, I don't really think I'd feel sane anymore. Perhaps it's just teenage hormones, but I've felt this way even before this. The only thing I have to combat this is, of course, weed which I use in moderation. I barely even cry anymore I've been so desensitized, or at least that's as best as I can put it.  


I have no distraction nor outlet except for the internet. I have no affinity for physical things such as sports and other things, nor any other group where I have to socialize, though I have improved my personality and speaking quite a bit through this past year. I have practically no motivation either and simply avoid my problems by staying cooped up in my room and staying on the internet.  


I only have one single hope. I have been thinking of maybe working up the courage to speak to my school councilor and getting a referral to a medical professional to diagnose me with something so I can at least understand what I'm fighting, but I have no hope for therapy or any of that. My mother has tried getting me it through the Canadian government for free to no avail, so we can't afford any therapy, especially with COVID.

One time I remember us driving somewhere, but my parents got in a fight and my dad abruptly stopped the car. He went out and told us he would let a car run over him, even though it didn’t happen and probably wasn’t going to. I ran out of the car too, and told him that if he did that, I’d do it too. 

My parents calmed down a bit after that, but my mom was still crying. We were going to a restaurant, and we all had to pretend we were fine. I was comforting my mom, and my brother was comforting my dad. It was one of the worst moments in my life. I was probably around 11 or 12 years old.

My parents really fought a lot more back then. They stopped fighting a bit after I developed my eating disorder (2 years ago, I was 13).

My parents really fought a lot growing up, and I had to take the parent role multiple times. Now I’m just numb to screaming and fighting, I no longer react strongly to yelling.

1," I've been friends with this person for about 4 years now and he's a genuinely smart and good person. He had a terrible childhood, both his parents were drug addicts in and out of jail, his mom beat him bloody from the age of 2 onward, his grandma is emotionally abusive, his uncle is a neo-nazi drug dealer. He ran away from home and was homeless for about 2 weeks. Eventually, he was enrolled in a program that houses homeless teenagers. He told me that he wanted to murder his mom, grandma, and older brother. He told me that had been his main goal in life for about 6 years now. I understand where he's coming from but I want the best for him and I don't think giving into violent urges is the answer. His parents are horrible people and I'm scared if he gives in to these urges hell end up just like them. I've tried to talk to him about it but he told me his mind was made and that no matter what I said he'd still go through with his plans. I know he's a good and smart person who was thrown into a terrible environment at birth.

1,"What are you suppose to do when you just can't anymore? I've been battling my depression since early childhood and right now I'm just tired. I've recently slipped into another depressive episode which leaves me unable to work, care for myself and leave the house. My crippling anxiety leaves me unable to ask for help, call a doctor I don't have or go to a hospital.

This situation comes about every couple of months now and is just getting more frequent. I can't do it anymore. I've always been suicidal in the sense that I wish I was dead but could never follow through due to my parents still being alive but now it just seems why not? My entire family lives on the other side of the country and we rarely speak (due to my anxiety and tendency to self isolate and push people away). I don't have any friends who aren't colleagues, and truth be told, if I stopped working at my current place of employment I'd end up pushing them away too.

Yes I am medicated but it doesn't seem to help, not really sure if it ever did to be honest. I'm unable get a doctor to help.

So here I am at the end of my rope writing this post on reddit and I'm not sure why. I feel like I've accepted that the only logical choice is to kill myself and get it done with. Eternal nothingness sounds like bliss to me. If I was dead my employer would find another to fill my shoes and have someone that wouldn't break down on the job constantly. Less stress for them.

1,"My genetics are littered with mental illness, my father lost his brother to suicide exactly one month before I was born. He was 23. My mother is an alcoholic and has been diagnosed with bipolar for years but her case is far worse than mine.

I am 29 now, and one of four siblings. I am the oldest which meant that I took the brunt of things growing up, helping raise my younger siblings while my mom was out drinking or in a mental hospital and while my dad, the most selfless and hardworking man I know, was making a living for my family. Somehow my brothers and sisters ended up just fine and we are all extremely close which I am so grateful for.

The thing funny thing is, I wouldn't change a thing. My struggles have shaped me and I am a stronger and more well-rounded person because of what I've been through. However, only my very close friends and family know this fact about me.

Now after being out for two years with no SH relapse I'm doing pretty ok. I'm not really depressed anymore,only at the evening or if I stayed sober the whole day. The only thing I really struggled with is anxiety. My parent and everyone else thinks I'm pretty much healed and I don't want to ruin this impression as I know how it affected them and their psyche as well. Once my dad drove me in the same city the psychiatrie was in and he just started crying which he never does. If it wasn't for them I definitely would've gone back there at least once.

Even tough I resisted the urge to cut for two years winter depression and quarantine drove me to scratch open my upper leg and it felt gorgeous. I didn't use a blade as I knew I couldn't leave it at a few cuts then. The thing is I don't really feel this big time depression as before,more a wave of nostalgia because that time and the year or two before going there are pretty much the only thing I remember from my childhood. I try to clinge to these memories and try to wake the feelings I felt back then. Back then I really didn't enjoy most of it but now at least it was somehow fulfilling unlike whatever state I'm at now. I often try to make myself cry, but I just can't.

1,"its about time i came clean.... i have made a few posts before but i think its time to tell you all where this battle began........  


my depression battle began back in 2002, im in high school \[secondary school as im in the UK\]  
I was a bully victim not a normal Bully Victim \[i am going to get a shit ton of hate for this\] in the first year i was the ONLY white kid in year 7 so i was already an outsider, in their eyes, mentally beaten before the actual BEATINGS began.......  


after a year of this, i ended up at a psychotherapist, who which i never knew was some one who can see into the spiritual mind \[if you believe in that sort of thing, but im open minded when it comes to that sort of thing\]  
they even said that this is not trauma, its the beginning of a clinical depression battle thanks to those who bullied me for being white \[AGAIN this is 2002-2003\]   


as time moved on after getting Expelled from that shit hole, i was improving had a few girlfriends relationships did not work out, then we move to 2010 i ended up meeting some one who i thought was the one. was a good relationship for a time 3 years dating then on the 13th of may 2013 while we was on holiday \[vacation for everyone else\] i popped ""the question"" on a stage of a show we was seeing, while they was on a break \[Luckily the person running the show was a friend of mine\]

She said yes i was happy, for fucking once in my miserable existence i was happy..... then only 10 months later.... what felt like i was stabbed by a blunt one handed broad sword, by some prick who decides fate. my grand father dies. \[he stayed around while i was in that god damn hospital... i was in there for 12 fucking hours after i had the call he was there\]   


after i got back to the shit pit i called a home at the time... 20 minutes passed, i had the phone call i DID NOT want to hear..... my grand father passed on, i snapped inside punching every wall, Door and window, bloody was dripping on my floor before my Fiancé at the time came home after she heard what happen....  


i began pushing EVERYONE away since.... in my teen age years me and my dad's relationship was rocky \[typical alpha male bullshit\] but even he knew how close i was to my grand father \[just to clarify my grandfather in this post is my moms side, to this day i have NEVER met my dads father\]  


after the funeral, this is where the depression hit a new low and when i say new low every December \[being it would be my grandfathers birthday\] And i caught that bitch of an ex fiancé cheat on me with a prick my hometown knew as a wrongen as he is known as a child rapist....... yes my fiancé \[GF\] cheated on me with a god damn pedophile... i was angry, willing to do 25 years to life for beating the bastard in more ways than most can imagine...   


ever since then i have hated the month of december and end up intaking more alcohol then i normally would...... my grandfather birthday shares they day i cuaght that thing sleep with some one so disgusting that a day in hell is a vacation

1,"Trigger warning this is a a true story about me, and deals with some heavy shit if you’re not ready to hear about it please don’t read this. My whole life I’ve been depressed, that probably isn’t true but it feels like it. As far back as I can recall I’ve been unhappy with myself. It all started when I was 10 and a man who I’ll call J came into my life.he was my mother’s boyfriend, and I quickly learn that his sexual interests extended past my mom and to me. After a mouth of him being in my life the light assault turned to full blown rape ever other day. He was a alcoholic and at the time so was my mother, meaning she never noticed it happening. And for some reason I never tried informing her of it, to this day she still doesn’t have any idea of the mental, sexual, and physical abuse I went through on a daily basis. I think I don’t want to tell her because I’m embarrassed of it, but that’s besides the point. His magnum opus of abuse was during a holiday. Every summer when I was a kid we would try to leave our city and go somewhere nice to relax. This instance we decided to go to a place called Vancouver in Britain Columbia Canada. My mother and brother came along with us but we got separate rooms, my brother with my mom and me with J. One night he drove back after a long night of drinking and cheating on my mom. He was absolutely hammered. He came to my room and woke me up and said he wanted to “play a game”. I knew what this means it’s his code word for fucking me. I don’t know what time it was exactly but outside it was quite blue. So it must of been 3-5 in the morning. Needless to say I wasn’t really that exited to “play” but I knew if I said no I would get beaten, so I without saying anything stood up and got ready. Without going into to much detail he started making me suck his cock, I instinctively started biting down due to the pain it caused. He ripped me off and started yelling at me about how he’s going’s to kill me but not before he rapes and murders my mother in front of me. He stormed out of the room and I thought maybe I got away with it, but a minute or so later he comes back in with a knife, pins me down and presses it to my chest. He tells me that I’ll finish what I started or he’ll rip my heart out. (I’m sorry if I rushed true that but it’s difficult to talk about for me) And so I did. After that instance I didn’t talk for a mouth, but the abuse didn’t stop. One day well I was sitting alone on the playground I got called to the office and I was informed that J had overdosed and died. You would think this would make me happy but for some reason I felt attached to him, like it was my fault he’s dead. Since this whole ordeal I was never the same, in a Attempt to feel better about myself I started eating. It was my only coping method, I had no friends and I definitely couldn’t talk to my family about it as my mom was still in love with J. So I got fat and as soon as the abuse at home stopped the abuse at school started, I was called balloon boy and many other insults and slurs. Then high school started, I was never very smart so I was put in a “bridging class” basically I wasn’t dumb enough to go to a special school, but I wasn’t smart enough to go to normal classes. The good news was I actually started making friends we would skip class and smoke weed and talk about all the women we fucked when we all knew none of us have even had our first kiss. Somehow these kids got me involved with the “cool kid” and this is most likely the worst thing to ever happen to me. Two people stood out from the rest of them I’ll call them joe and John. Joe stood out because of how nice he was to me, instantly I felt like he could be my best friend. But John stood out because of how much he reminded me of my now deceased stepfather. Immediately he started abusing me he would had to hangout with me just so he could get me drunk and start beating me, anytime I would find I woman I like he would go tell her horrible lies about me or make a fake account with my name and message vulgar racist things just to make sure I couldn’t be happy. No joke at one point he told Joe that the reason he was so awful to me is because he thought it would be funny if I killed myself because of him. This continued for years up to the recent quarantine, I thought it was all over. This was my last year and if I never had to go back to school I would never have to see him again. Life for a while was good my mom stopped drinking and stated smoking weed. I got a new step dad and he’s great and my mom even started buying me weed. After about a mouth of being trapped inside with my mother I started to open up to her about what I’ve been feeling and I got put on medicine to help with my adhd depression and my anxiety. But this moment of happiness would last as we after a bit went back to school, it seems that John wanted to make up for lost time of abuse. And it ramped up tenfold, it was also at this time I found out that my stepdad cheated on my mom and with my mom having a void were he used to be she filled it with liquor. And so did I there was so much booze in the house she would notice if I stole some, and I became very dependent on it. It was around this time my suicidal thoughts started getting heavier. And to top it all off Joe my best friend overdosed and died at 17 years old. And that leads us to now. I started cutting not just cutting but burning myself with a lighter  punching brick walls and a multitude of other ways to hurt myself. My suicidal thoughts are only getting worse and I have no one to talk to. If you made it this far than hopefully you can help me with my problems I don’t even know why I hurt myself, it’s just makes me feel a escape. I am concerned that one day I’m going to kill my self and I don’t know what to do.",mentalhealth,I started cutting,Early life,
1,"My fear of being abandoned is weighing hard on my life right now. I hate that it affects me as much as it does. I’m in a relationship with a wonderful girl who I love very much, and even then, it still causes problems for me. 

I’m not trying to say I had the worse life - all things considered, my life really wasn’t bad at all. My parents divorced when I was 7 years old. I went from seeing my dad everyday to seeing him twice a month. I remember hiding in the back of his car when he’d drop me off of my mom’s house. I remember crying everyday and every minute at school after I moved. I remember hiding in the house each morning to try and avoid going to school just because I wanted to cry. 

My mom sent me to therapy after a few months, and after that I started doing a lot better. And like I said, I didn’t have the worst life or anything but there was some problems. 

From what I’ve told therapists and other people, I grew up in an abusive and neglectful household, though I didn’t feel it at the time. Alcoholics, drug using, and just narcissistic parents.  You know the drill. 

I remember my visiting my dad during certain weekends and him getting drunk and telling me to never come back. I remember when my mom fought my first stepdad over medication and the cops come over. I remember when my stepdad killed himself weeks later when my mom stopped wanting to see him. 

I remember when my aunt took me in and for the first time I felt like I had a mother. I’ll always remember the phone call I got when I found out she passed away from a heart attack.

1,"I don’t know how to start this or even where to start. I have been really struggling . At the moment it feels as if i dont deserve the good things in my life.

My brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I’m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not I'm as good as other people or worthy enough to be alive. In a moment of stupidity I shut the door and encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn’t last long a 30 seconds, maybe I don’t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that’s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent, it makes me feel as though I don’t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.

I hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I cant have any self esteem or positive image of myself.

In all other regards i was a normal teen. Other than being anxious and a little depressed. its just this weird thing i did which is horrible. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do.

1,"I'm a 16 year old male, and for the first time, I'm truly ready to die.

In the past, I've had suicidal thoughts. I've attempted a few times, but quickly stopped from fear. But I feel like I'm ready to die now.

My mental health is in freefall, and I feel completely lost. I feel like that's a big misconception about depression. For me, the world isn't crashing and burning around me - the world is fine. I'm the one that's crashing.

I've tried to cope in many different ways over the past few years - self harm, self poisoning, hurting my body against objects, eating too much, eating too little, etc. Hell, I even had a masturbation addiction at one point. I hate that I couldn't stop myself from doing these things, but I understand why I did them - to transform emotional pain to physical pain.

I don't trust my parents. Whenever someone is upset in my house (which is mainly me), they immediately get annoyed. I tried to open up to them in the past but it's like they're completely unfeeling towards it, even trying to avoid talking about it at all. I remember one time I self harmed and didn't try to hide it. I guess that was my way of going ""please, PLEASE notice me. Please, see what is happening. I need your help."" But when my parents saw, all they did was scold me for it. They called me childish and said I was only doing it for attention. In a way, I guess I was.

I just wanted them to listen. Whenever I mess up, it's all verbal insults. Recently, I started sixth form, and to avoid my ever-darkening thoughts, I buried myself in work, completing notes for a 2-year A-Level course in the timespan of 6 days. My parents kept saying I should have a work-life balance, so I started playing Minecraft while on call with my friends. They didn't like that. They started calling me lazy, and saying I do nothing anymore. I didn't know what to think, or how to feel anymore. Whenever I try to go up to my room throughout the day, they get mad, saying I disappear. They make me spend as much of the day downstairs with them as possible, but we don't do anything together. Except when we're forced to watch movies together EVERY NIGHT. They don't even care about what I want.

To clarify, I live in a family of 6, and have 3 siblings. I'm the oldest, and so am forced to look after them. This is fine, but it's like my parents expect me to be their full-time parent, and they barely do anything anymore. My sisters are 5 and 6 years old, and I'm expected to help them with all their homework. My brother, who is 12, has autism. I am also expected to help him with any work he has. Along with this, I have chores. A lot of them. I do the dishes, hoovering the house (which is reasonably large), do all the dust, clean the bathrooms, wash the outside of both my parent's cars, along with hoovering the inside of the cars. I have to cut the grass in the garden, along with shower my sisters, and hoover downstairs every single day. I do not get paid for this, but I never expected to get paid for helping my family. My problem is that they don't do anything to help me, instead scolding me when I accidentally mess up, or if I haven't cleaned properly.

I can't take this responsibility anymore, along with all the work I have from school, and all the exams I have to prepare for. It's too much.

I've tried to speak to my parents about this, but, as you might have guessed by now, all they do is get angry with me and punish me even more - taking away my phone and laptop, the second of which I actually need for my homework and studying. They don't care.

I know I'm not perfect - I'd argue I'm on the worse side of humanity. I find myself getting angry quite easily, along with panicked. When my sisters start arguing with me or lying, I get really stressed and angry, often arguing or shouting back. The same goes for my 12 year old brother. We get into fights, with him taunting me or hitting me, and I hit back, but I hit back hard (due to me being older). I feel terrible for it. I tend to self harm whenever I do - as punishment.

I've tried to talk about some of this to my parents, but they get mad at me. So, naturally, I decided to confide in my close friends.

I don't hang around many people. 5 or 6 of the people I talk to I would consider my friends, but I only have 3 close ones. One of them, when I talked to about this, sympathized, and understood more than most. But, over time, I was constantly being reminded how I'm doing better off than most people, yet I'm still complaining about life. It hurts even more because what he is saying is true, and I have no excuse for that. Another friend, one which I considered my closest for a long time, was told by me about my self harm and depression. She started making me promise to not do it, on the condition that if I did, she would stop eating, or hurt herself. I've grown apart from her, which I'm glad. I can't deal with that anymore, making empty promises, and hurting people when I inevitably break them. The last of my close friends doesn't know about any of this. They only noticed I self harmed, but only brought it up once. I don't want to tell them though. I know if I will, they'll see me differently, and I can't do that anymore - not to myself, and not to them, either.

I hardly sleep anymore. Whenever things go quiet, my suicidal thoughts and urge to self harm return. That's why I try to keep my mind busy at all times. When I'm doing something, I like to have my phone playing anything in the background, just so it distracts me more and more. I can't sleep easily, but I also sleep too much afterwards. It's all a vicious cycle, and my parents are getting more and more mad with me, and I hate myself more and more for disappointing them every day.

I know that if I keep on living, I'll end up hurting myself, or someone else. I can't afford to keep hurting people. I just want to die, and move on, anywhere.

I take medication for Raynaud's, which also doubles as high blood pressure medication. Since I have trouble sleeping, there would be no trouble me getting sleeping pills prescribed. Obviously, I'll try them a few days beforehand, to test how strong they are, and how long the effects are. Then, on a night where I know I won't be disturbed, I will take more high blood pressure medication than I should - this should slow my body's functions, even if it is a little bit. Then, I will take more than enough sleeping medication, and go to bed, with a plastic bag wrapped around my head via rubber bands, or something of the sort. I will wear a cap so that the bag doesn't stick to my face, and have a large enough bag so that I pass out before I lose oxygen.

I'll leave my suicide note on my desk, which would only contain me telling my family and friends how much I loved them, and how sorry I am - I won't be mentioning any of this thread, etc. I will then fall asleep, and eventually run out of oxygen, at which point my brain will begin decaying, and I will eventually die due to cerebral hypoxia. A peaceful end, and a quiet one too. The body would be mostly preserved.

I don't expect anyone to read all of this, but if you have, thank you. Truly. You've already done more than my family or friends ever have. I tried to talk to everyone, I've tried every option. I've tried self destructive methods like self-poisoning, self harming, not eating, eating a lot, sleeping too much, not sleeping, etc. I've tried ""normal"" methods such as therapy, opening up, but nothing has worked, and I believe it's far too late for me.

I'm just so lost, and I feel like death is my only escape. Even if it wasn't, I feel like it's the preferable option.

If there's anything you could say to help, or to give advice on, please do. I don't want sympathy, I just want to know if there's any better alternatives than death in my current situation. I just want to be at peace, and I'm sorry you've ever had to read this.",SuicideWatch,I'm not sure what to do anymore,Early life,

Never letting me buy anything without complaining, calling me 50 times a day when i finally leave the house, expecting me to have been married at 23. Waking me up to pray every morning at 6 am.

When I was 7 my parents divorced.

Afterwards I was diagnosed with severe depression and tried to kill myself for the first time when I was 9.

Not that anyone bothered.

""Stop trying to grab attention"" ""Just be happy"" ""Just get over it""

My grades started dropping and I was sent to a mental facility after a violent outburst at age 10.

When I was 12 I was sent to a house where troubled teens could live. Criminals. Who did hard drugs. I didn't need something like that, I needed a psychiatrist.

Half a year later I was sent to a place akin to a boot camp. There I was raped 6 times, which is also how I discovered that I was bisexual.

 I'm currently living in a shared flat where teens with eating disorders get the help they need. But I don't have the strength to go on.

I don't even have the strength to finish this post.

I'll try and tell my story to the best of my ability.

As an elementary schooler, I was angry and violent. The littlest things set me off into rage and I'd fight other kids on the playground who annoyed me in the slightest. I'd flip chairs and attack teachers in retaliation of having to work. The violence was partially fueled by actual pure rage and an early videogame addiction that I am still yet to beat. I'd imagine myself a monster and fantasized about shooting up the school. Part of the outlet for these rage fantasies was my sister. She seemed to make me furious every day and every day I would beat her and beat her and scar her over and over again.

Middleschool helped reduce the violence because of the new threat of real punishment for assault, but it was never fully gone. Puberty hit me like a truck. Or more like a sedan with a boost engine. As a middleschooler I had no control over myself. My sexuality was off the walls. I gained a porn addiction very quickly and am still far far from getting anywhere close to beating it. At some point in the summer of 6th grade I had coerced my much younger sister to have sex with me and was on the verge of going through with it but was nearly caught by my dad checking in on us in my room, stopping me. If it weren't for that coincidence I would've raped her far worse than I already have. I was literally inches away from inserting it. I'm convinced I traumatized her and it makes me feel guilty just seeing her every day and constantly being reminded of the toll of my sins. I ruined my own sisters life because I just can't control myself, sexually or emotionally.

Middleschool also marked the end of a lot of my old friendships and in a weird attempt to fit in I chose to act out weirdly and sexually. I told hundreds and hundreds of people about the sister story and carried it around like a badge of honor until I realized it was something to be ashamed of. The entire damn school knew me as the creepy pedophile idiot who annoys everyone and I still carry remnants of that reputation with me today and it's so painful. Everyone hates me and I'm avoided like the plague.

Highschool freshman year was the start of my real depression. I started realizing my world was falling apart around me. I thought my reputation was funny and cool but when it set in it set in hard. The guilt for the sister situation was strong. I started collecting child p*rn and kept it up for nearly a year before my parents discovered it and deleted it all. I knew what I was doing was wrong but kept doing it anyways. I truly came to the conclusion that I was an incel and I still stand by that today. I'm an incel. My middleschool love life was pathetic. I really only dated one girl named zoe and ruined it with her when I groped her without her permission. Years later now we're close friends but the torment of guilt of hurting yet another person because of my urges weighed on me heavily at that time. The closest I got to a relationship after that was several love notes that each got systematically rejected one by one. I've had 2 recent relationships since then, one with a guy named Dawson and another named Madison, who both broke up with me after seeing me in person and never gave real explanations for why they did. I know I'm ugly and thats why. I'm irredeemably ugly. Not just physically, but mentally. I'm a horrible person and I hurt everyone around me without regard or control. 

The closest I came to happiness was with madison. She seemed so perfect for me. I felt truly loved for once. I spent every hour of my day talking to her. I loved her with everything I had. Then we met in person. The next day she broke up with me. It was my longest relationship and yet it only lasted a month. I was torn apart. My world was ruined. I cried and cried every night. Eventually I decided to finally do it, I was gonna wait until I was home alone and then shoot myself. I told madison beforehand my plan and gave her my goodbyes and I told her I loved her. She managed to get into contact with my parents on facebook and thus I was prevented from being home alone. My parents forced me into therapy which I've always hated. I've had suicide ideation nearly every day since then but am yet to make a serious plan. However, I did write a note which is no longer relevant and I should rewrite. 

Madison and I tried to be friends after the whole ordeal. I still loved her deep down but held it in and focused on just being her friend. But I got annoying and she got mad and she blocked me on everything. I wad devastated again. I was suicidal once again for several days. Ever since I've been using games as a coping method and have been disossaciating from close friends and am slowly but surely burning my friendships away that I've spent so much hard work building. I'm no longer capable of being a good friend. I'm worthless and a burden. My life should just end now.",SuicideWatch,I'm 15 and my life is a blight on myself and others,Early life,
1,"It’s my fault for thinking anyone would actually love me. My fault for being vulnerable with someone who asked me why “I let myself be molested” at thirteen and was never there for me. I’m realizing now how dismissive and cruel they were to me. I had someone encouraged me to dump them sooner, but I cared about them and I thought they cared about me. 

I’m done with them now, and I’m still bitter and angry and hurting I feel like my heart is going to explode. I feel like I was brought into this world to be used and abused. And I’m not even allowed to complain, or else I’m “weird.” I just come on here to vent and I’m not even allowed that. Then again, that’s also my fault because Reddit is insensitive, but I have no one else to talk to about this. Everything traumatic that’s ever happened is always just left there to fester. 

And then people wonder why I act the way I do. People wonder why I’m so broken and reserved and shy, even after years of therapy and meds and sinking myself into my hobbies and doing my best to stay strong and pretending to be happy for others’ sake. I’m just stupid and it’s my fault and no one wants to hear it. My abusers are left alone because my pain doesn’t matter.

I’m tired of being hurt I’m tired of being abandoned I’m tired of being ignored and invalidated. My only reason for not making another attempt on my life is due to my new kittens.

My brain keeps fixating on an event from my late teen years I think 17/19 and I’m worried what it means about me and my life and whether or not I'm as good as other people or worthy enough to be alive. In a moment of stupidity I shut the door and encouraged the family dog to lick me down there, it didn’t last long a 30 seconds, maybe I don’t know , but the fact I was capable of doing that of thinking for a split second that’s that was ok or even an option mortifies me. I am terrified it makes me a monster akin to people who abuse and molest and take advantage of the weak and innocent, it makes me feel as though I don’t deserve to live and suicide constantly rattled around my head as my only release.

I hate that I ruined my life story. That I can never look back fondly on my past self because she was capable of this thing that mortifies me. I cant have any self esteem or positive image of myself.

In all other regards i was a normal teen. Other than being anxious and a little depressed. its just this weird thing i did which is horrible. I wish with all my being I could take it back I really do. I worry that I’ll never find love because I feel I don’t deserve it, and I worry I will never be able to enjoy sex because any time I do anything enjoyable that is related to sex by myself or with a partner I am reminded of my worst action it plays constantly in my head and ruins everything.

I was humiliated often, verbal abused by EVERYONE in the cohort for my acne daily (names like ugly, monster, wash face with toilet water?) and punched in my head even when i didnt do anything. It didnt helped that my father blamed me for everything and scolded me for the smallest thing i do. I still remembered one time he told me i was a failure. Im suprised i havent hanged my self in secondary school.

So after secondary school, i got a skillset of negative self esteem, social awkardness and anti socialness. Then in high school, for some reason, i felt that my class did not like me much although i followed them around for lunch, activities etc. How do i know they did not like me? They celebrated everyones' birthday except mine. Hell no one even wished me happy birthday for my past 10 years. Thats when i knew if there was a sacrifice situation, im the first to go. So i went to another gang in class and got hooked into smoking and bad results. Now I am in my last year of highschool and has a smoking addiction and GPA of 1.2. 

Ive seen many of my secondary school bullies lead a glorious and dream life, partying everyday and fucking many girls while i stayed at home most of the time playing dota like a loser and working out trying to change myself to no avail.

1,"Funny enough, this is my first reddit post. I've been a lurker for almost a year but recently finding this community has made me want to share my thoughts on this world and my struggle. Things may seem rushed, and im willing to expand  on details in the comments. Just need to get it all out.1st, my creation was a farce to begin with. My mother was raped when my biological father was high on drugs. The only reason why I was born was because she was in poverty and couldn't afford to get an abortion. Luckily though he died when I was 6. What hurts even more is that I have autism. My mother resents me for it, wishing I was never born instead of being cursed with a mentally handicapped child. School wasn't much better, lots of relentless bullying. One of my teachers used to work with my mom and has a grudge against her, and used it to take it out on me in class. My first attempt was in 7th grade. Between 7th grade and graduating high school I tried to commit suicide 18 times. Then I tried to go to college, and attempted another 5. After college was when I got my first taste of how despicable things were. My first job was at a local rec center. I was a custodian. Worked very early hours and the building was mostly full of retired people. None of them respected me. I was treated like a slave and lesser human being because of my inability to socialize and timid nature. Many of them called me homophobic slurs as well because of my naturally swooped hair. They also called my black coworker racist slurs but besides the point. 
Now, im 24, depressed, anxiety ridden, not high functioning enough to work a decent job, not high functioning enough to drive a car, stuck with my step father who's only personality trait is complaining about politics and why im such a pathetic loser over things I can't control. What pushed me to the edge most recently is my insurance dumping my medication. I cantbafford any of it anymore.

1,"Just need to get this off my chest. I can't fucking take it. It's almost Christmas, and I have to visit my family, and the thought makes me fucking sick. I know they want the best for me, and are panicking due to my attempts, but they don't want to admit that they can't control this. My dad constantly yells at me, ""why can't you just clean your room"", and both me and professional have already told him that I can't cause of my depression, autism and schizophrenia. When I was starting to become ill, I didn't go to school for a month cause I worried I had a flu that could kill me. It was to the point where I washed my face with soap, and drank and sniffed soap mixed with water, cause I thought it would stop me from getting infected. But according to him, I was just acting cause I was too lazy to go to school, and when I was terrified that I couldn't sleep, he yelled at me and told me that I'm just doing it for sympathy, going so far as to parody me. And my mom is so over worried that it's more like me who has to take care of her, than her having to take care of me. When I'm home, I have to stay up at night cause she can't stand me laying in bed with suicidal thoughts. I told her that I'm not gonna act on it for the night, still won't let me rest. It doesn't help that she called me a ticking timebomb, and telling me that I was dumb for doing drugs, like it's just fucking easy to stop. When I took 'a gram of speed, I was cured for 6 hours - that's a long time when you're in misery most the time. I've been sober for six months just so my abuse wouldn't hurt them, no appreciation from my dad whatsoever. When I try to explain to them that I lose control cause the pain is too much, they just look at me like I'm coming up with bad excuses. According to my dad, I just lack willpower, like he is rational 24/7, even though he smashed our computer just cause the printer wouldn't work.

They are not bad parents, and they've also done a lot of good for me, but gosh, I'd just wish they'd realize that they can't help me as long as they can't understand what I'm going through. I'm not gonna rationalize it anymore just cause they want the best, they are one of the reasons I'm this fucked up. I just wish I could go back in time and make some other sperm cell fertilize that egg, so they'd get someone who wouldn't a genetic freak like me, so they could be happy, and I could not exist.

It was a married couple who took me just for the money. I lived there like an animal, they didn't allow me anything, they beat me, insulted me. I was about 13 at the time and I was very depressed. I would cry in the school toilet, room, I didn’t have my home, my family or my parents. I was dead inside and I wanted to die many times ... but I never tried I honestly don't know why.

1,Abused since childhood yet over coddled,SuicideWatch,Should I kill myself tonight,Early Life,
1,"I’ll give you a list of evidence that proves I am and have always been beyond saving.


A girl in 1st grade didn’t like me. When she moved, she let everyone in the classroom hug her except me.


In 2nd grade, I got beat up by the class tard. Yes, the CLASS TARD. The kid who once announced that he shat himself during class. The kid who was genuinely weird.


I had frequent crushes throughout school and would approach girls in cringy and creepy ways.


In 3rd grade, I cried during tag and the kids who I played with told me they were not my friend anymore.


I was the recipient of the oreo game in 6th grade (look it up)


In middle school, I loudly repeated my childhood best friend’s joke in such a way that embarrassed both of us. We stopped being friends soon afterward.


I got obsessed with being popular in middle and high school. To me, this involved hanging out with friends, going to parties, sleepovers/bonfires, drugs and alcohol, and generally having fun with friends. I did none of that at all.


I tried joining a friend group, but one girl said she was not comfortable being around me. She eventually reported me for touching her, even though I did nothing. I got so angry at her that I leaked her social media and address on the internet. I also did the same to another girl who said she hated me.


This one hurt. In junior year, I had a math class with a girl who I became really good friends with. Unfortunately, she started hanging out with the girl I doxxed, so I got jealous. I became increasingly clingy until she outright told me that I creeped her out and she had to move seats away from me in class. The next year, I paid for a ticket that prompted a list of best friend matches based on a short personality test, and guess who’s name was listed as my best match? That’s right, the same girl that I had creeped out the previous year.


I lasted two weeks at a 4 year college before ending up in a mental hospital because I just couldn’t handle a college social life. 




I have noticed that I am starting to get sucked into the alt right and inceldom, which I have struggled with back in middle/high school. I don’t want to be a nazi or a racist or an incel.


Give me one reason why I should keep going. My dad left, my mom is struggling to make ends meet, and I feel like such a burden on my family and the world. I frequently get glares from women who think i’m staring at them. And to make things worse, I have developed a fear of small children and their screaming (I get anxious around kids and have panic attacks if they scream), making working in most entry level jobs and going anywhere in public unbearable. I feel like there is no end in sight to my misery, and I want to end this cycle of despair. I’m no saint, but surely there is a way I can somehow be redeemed, right?",SuicideWatch,I’m beyond saving at this point,Early Life,
1,"TL;DR I'm just another number


I'm almost 30. The age at which I said I would allow myself to end it if nothing worked out a kind of self-imposed deadline haha.....  


I honestly thought I could do it, that I could somehow become happy, or at least maintain some kind of balance. I've tried hard, really fucking hard, to be the ""best"" person I can be and honestly I think I achieved that It's just that even at my best I'm not worth it.


Growing up my life was hell, both my parents were alcoholics my Dad was just in general neglectful there were only like three times where we would interact the first being him shouting or hitting me when he got too drunk, the second and I've never figured out why he would drop me off and pick me up from school something he was adamant about which more of than not resulted in me being late everyday and sometimes waiting for up to two hours for him to come pick me up and lastly he was a big fan of junk food sometimes he would get drunk and let me eat with him which was probably the highlight of my childhood. My ""mother"" on the other hand just seemed to hate me just thinking about her used to give me panic attacks. It seemed like her goal was to knock out all the types of abuse she could and the worst thing was her smile and laughter throughout it all. I could write a whole page out of the shit she used to do to me from the hitting, kicking, slapping, scratching, spitting, choking, pricking me with needles to making me eat burnt food/food off the floor to the touching... Also family activites like going out to drink and leaving me in the car.


The abuse I suffered at home made my brain In all its wisdom decide the best way to cope with everything is to eat and i had no shortage of crappy strongly flavoured food at home as you can guess i was fat, extremely fat. You can probably also guess how that went for my school life who doesn't like the ugly, short, shy, awkward, fat kid? yeah, made It feel just like home.


Few years later parents died in a car crash, drinking and driving, and I felt nothing no joy or sadness. Moved in with a uncle I had no idea existed, got into a College, uncle got me a therapist.


My uncle was a high functioning(?) addict In that he had a stable job and people liked him, still he had his mood swings and what not It was heaven compared to before. Also not sure if this is common with addicts, but he would have these moments of extreme clarity, moments where he would talk about his problems and have plans laid out on how to fix them. He would talk to me about his and my dads childhood in those moments and it was much of the same abuse he would call it a cycle and it's why he decided not to have any children. The talks with him were the main reason why I stayed away from alcohol and drugs, addiction seemed to run in the family and It's what killed both of them in the end.


Looking back I can say that my therapist at that time was absolutely horrible I would go to her and tell her about the struggles I would have trying to make friends, control my eating habits, falling behind the rest of the class and she would just repeat some variation of Are you trying your best? and Fake it till you make it. Advice which I took whole heartedly and what ultimately led me to my first suicide attempt. I constantly felt like I wasn't doing my best and kept pushing and pushing untill I snapped It was completely on impulse I took a bunch sleeping pills and whatever other pills I could find and cut myself. I remember parts of it, breathing was incredibly hard as was moving, like my body was becoming numb and heavy and I just kind of drifted off. Woke up in a hospital extremely dizzy and had an intense headache for weeks. It was my uncle that found me, we never really talked about it at all, although he started to make promises of us going to the movies/bowling and other stuff, which never happened because of the addiction. It used to eat him up in his more sober moments and he would say he's sorry, I would tell him it was okay, but to this day I feel like shit knowing I was hurting him.


After the attempt I couldn't eat, I would always throw everything up, but i still found myself trying to eat whenver i felt stressed. On the bright side I lost most of the weight I went from 130 odd kg to 50kg. Did nothing for how I felt about my body because now instead of fat It's all loose skin and stretch marks. Took a few years to get it under control. Lost majority of my hair at this time as well.


Started attending multiple groups every week, was seeing a new therapist, made ""friends"" from said groups, uncle got me a job, started volunteering on top of that, travelled a bit, did a bunch of crap from water painting to skydiving at the behest of my therapist. 


After telling my therapist out of everything I tried, there was nothing that I enjoyed, she told me to just do something to keep myself busy, something I could do to take my mind off things. I settled on exercise thinking it would do something about the way I feel about myself and that it was harder to get distracted than if i was doing something like painting. Started going to the gym had a set schedule but had to stop afer a bad experience, Then i took up bodyweight exercises at home, got pretty damn good at it, I was doing HSPUs, Dragon flags, etc. I thought those achievements would make me happy but no...


Going to work felt like I was back in school but this time the person in charge didn't have to pretend to be nice to you. I hated it, being blamed for things I wasn't taught how to do while others get a free pass, the mocking, anxiety I would get when I had to deal with customers. Just all round horrible.


Damn this is getting long, might as well skip to when I think my spiral back down started. It probably started after this encounter I had with a woman, I was basically laughed out of a bedroom, that drudged up a whole bunch of crap. Saw an old school bully who I decided to confront, to say that I'm still here even after everything they put me through, they had no idea who I was. Had a falling out with my therapist, my uncle passed away. I was reaching the end of my rope so I reached out to my ""friends"" for help, people that I've stayed up talking to all night when I had work the next day, given money to, bought groceries for, picked up their relatives from the airport and so on those ""friends"" who decided they had no time for me when I needed to talk. 


Not sure how much of this makes sense but yeah... originally i wanted to get this shit all of my chest and talk to someone, anyone who could relate in anyway but as I was writing this It just cemented my original plan. I'm done, I've got nothing left to give. Nothing but negative emotions and dark thoughts maybe I'm more like my mother than I thought.",SuicideWatch,At the end,Early Life,

    My dad innocent of hurting us didn't have a chance of getting custody in the 70s. He was working as a merchant marine and not in the state 6 months of if the year. On top of that mostly mothers got custody back then. Sidenote it was a landmark ruling and in law books.

He doesn’t think of me as his son, and apparently he never did. He always yells “You’re not my son” at me. My mom, the only person I have that can protect me, never does anything serious, and with that I mean she might say something at the time. But the following day, they all act like nothing happens (with each other), he’ll ignore my entire existence, and when he’s drunk again he’ll attack me. Its the same loop that has continued for so many years, he drinks at least half the month, every month. 

He kicked my eye one time when i was 12 which damaged my vision on my right eye. He broke my hand and wrist when I was 16. One time when I was 17 he grabbed me by my hair and started punching me all over my body, while trying to shield my face, I accidentally hit his teeth with my elbow (I’m a lot taller than he is) and knocked 2 of his teeth out (he has bad teeth due to years of alcohol and smoking). There are so many more occurrences of him being physically aggressive towards me, but I decided to keep it short. 

Ultimately, I cannot help that the rest of my family members (my older sister and mom), allow him to abuse me. I’m sick and tired of this.

But ever since this girl (who has been my friend since elementary and I fell in love with in high school) hurt and used me I’ve only regressed. I’m scared of human connection I’m scared of feeling the pain of it being severed again. And I feel so cowardly because of it. More than that now that I’m in my senior year all that I’ve worked for feels so meaningless the 5.0 GPA, the 10 APs, the clubs, my SATs, sports teams, and all of the grueling hours of work and sacrifice. All of it feels so empty... I don’t know what I was expecting but not this.

1,"I don’t know why I’m so depressed I have many good things going for me.

things started going bad when my father died when I was 15. 

I isolated myself. made no friends. experienced nothing. then senior year studied abroad.

the study abroad was in a developing country and broke my spirit. the director was cruel, the cohort cutthroat competitive, and my host family strictly dieted and emotionally abused me.

after that I went to college at one of the best schools. I love this school. I felt happy for the first time, away from an unhappy household. 

on the first day I met a girl who became my best friend. we did everything together. we went to nyc and it was the happiest three days of my life. I did anything for this girl. she said jump, I said how high. 

she would be cold to me sometimes - blow me off, come an hour late to plans, evade questions, silent treatment, wouldn’t text back. she didn’t like me talking to other people or family so I had no friends back then.

she was jealous, controlling, and possessive over me. she lied to other people and exhibited some manipulative behavior. 

she started liking me and asked me to be her gf. we dated and she rushed things when I wanted slow. we had sex a lot. she was obsessed with me and would not leave me alone. I was uncomfortable because it was really intense. 

we planned a trip together and my family bought her tickets ($800). I talked about it to everyone and I’d never looked forward to anything so much in my life.

she cancelled a week before we’d leave. I was so heartbroken I broke up with her. 

my family wanted reimbursement for the tickets and my ex gf screamed at me. I’ve never seen someone so mad, screaming I bought such expensive tickets as revenge. said it was just a trip and I should pay for it. I wish I hadn’t asked. 

this break up broke something inside of me. she lied to me, gaslit, and manipulated me so thoroughly I had no idea what was true. she told me she lied to me, but wouldn’t tell me about what. I have reasons to believe she may have cheated or worse. 

I was shocked she changed so much, I refused to believe she was bad. I stopped her whenever I saw her, texted her, and showed up to her study spots a few times. 

we had some good conversations where it looked like we’d become friends again, but I kept asking for (in general terms) the truth. she didnt want to tell me and got mad. she told me not to talk to her and blocked me.

I’ve seen her around. I have not talked to her for months. everyone I know hates her, thinks she abused me, and that she’s a psychopath. she has one friend people say she tricked. 

someone told me she wasn’t doing well and asked if I knew. I feel so bad and have been crying for the last couple days. I am so worried about her. there’s nothing I can do because I need to respect her boundary. 

I feel so guilty and sad. she had to block me in the spring! I feel like a monster. she has a rough background. I turned everyone against her because almost no one likes her and even hates her. I feel like I exaggerated things and misrepresented the situation which was a misunderstanding. I must’ve done something that made her act this way.

I don’t think I can ever know the truth and it hurts. I think she’s a good person and want to understand her side of the story. 

I can’t get over this girl. I know she was exceptional. I don’t think I’ll ever find someone like her again.",depression,"popular, good looking, talented, but depressed",Early Life,

I’m used to being the butt of the joke/people not liking me. I’m so used to it that I just assume everyone doesn’t like me. When someone is nice to me, I get really uncomfortable and push them away. I like when people treat me like shit because it’s what I’m used to. It makes me feel normal. This might just be who I am, but it hurts my relationships.

I'm too apathetic to do anything when I know I'll just die and enter the void of non-existing. My only skill is getting A's in school and convincing my friends and family that everything is A-OK when the last time I felt OK was three years ago when I learned that a mentally abusive teacher I had was fired, and even then she still serves as a substitute.

Every effort I've made at finding a calling or doing something with my life has resulted in a spiral of self-hate because I failed so stunningly. At my old job everyone took me as a joke because I look like I still go to middle school, and my boss ignored all my time off requests because I 'wasn't up to standards.' My therapist can't help me because she's too fucking idealistic with what my life is/should be, and doesn't accept that I can't do anything without being beaten down.

I can't do anything and haven't had a victory in years, and I can't even just wait for the end because the world will keep on turning.

So this happened last year (around september i dont rly remember).I was 15 , in high school  Ive had a friend in my class.We were like brothers and it was the first time ive had someone like that in my life because ive skipped school since lower primary up until high school because of financial problems which also led up to family problems.This gap was also part of the problem.Ive had problems socialising with people and he would help me with that.The class i was in was really toxic.It was crawling with bullies and stuff so naturally i  was a magnet to bullying.He would try to defend me from them.But one time one of them really took it far with me and tried to choke me out , i was tired of it and I dunno how in the world but i slapped the life out of this guy's face like it was some kind of fantasy.His buddies came in and i got some punishment for that.All of this happened while my friend was watching and he was doing nothing.Not even a word did he say to them like before.I was shocked to see him do that but he apologised to me saying he wouldnt make a change even if he was there.I was upset but eventually forgave him.Some time passed on and we were nearing finals exams when i started hearing rumors about my friend , like how he was ""doing things with his sister"" ""smoking"" , many weirder stuff.I wanted to ask him about these but i was scared that he would be upset about it if he misunderstood me for others who are spreading the rumour , so i didnt ask him.So the finals came , Me and Him Passed and We were in the same class again.There were new and old faces in my classroom(they were not toxic like the others).Our new class teacher(ill call her CT)was a very nice person , the whole atmosphere was so different.I was hoping this was the end of everything i suffered last year but i couldnt be more wrong....


Around Midterm Exams , The people in my class started talking weird to me.They would talk about my relationship with my friend and How I've met him and stuff but they wouldnt ask anything about me , it was always about him.So i was really weirded out why nobody would explain to me about why are they talking to me like this.In the middle of all of this , I've found out the truth.It was a classmate that told me about it and We havent really talked up until during this time.lets call her 'A'.She was a very honest person , she didnt care about me being shy to talk to girls. I was shocked to see that someone else actually cared about me.(I didnt want to ask her out later because i feared that she would reject me).She told me about the situation regarding my friend.She said that everyone are keen on me and my friend because they are hearing the same rumours i heard the previous year but this time i was targetted because i was his friend.But i was confused as to why i wasn't last year like this.She told me its better if you stopped hanging out with me.At that point i was mentally conflicted about leaving the person that helped me with social anxiety (i was better at socialising now then before) and my only friend.I told her that not to judge him under the basis of these rumours and i dropped the conversation there.She also suggested that i shouldnt attract unwanted attention to myself but I was keen on finding out the truth of the matter.

Some days passed.
One day , it was at break time and my friend pulled out a iphone from his pocket out of nowhere and started showing off to others and the problem is that it was illegal for students to bring any devices with a camera to school. the worst part was that he started to take pictures of others and especially the girls.They were uncomfortable with it so i suggested to him that he should stop it and he didnt really care then.He proceeded to then show it off to people outside the classroom and at that time i knew that this was a recipe for disaster when i saw him do that.The break ended and we went back to our seats.The teacher came in and took class as normal.It was a bit noisy and out of nowhere i hear dead silence in the classroom.I look to my left where the door to the class is and i see our CT and another teacher together looking at me and my friend(who's beside me).I knew this was about the phone.CT calls him to come out of the classroom and calls other classmates too.He quickly tells me not to let a word out.The other teacher comes to me and she gave one of the scariest glares i've ever seen.She asks me about it and i said that i had no clue that there was such a thing with him and she laughs it off and says that she knows that me and him are buddies and she knows i saw it.At this point i knew that the person who snitched let them know about us and the fact that i saw the phone.I was cornered with no way out.I kept on saying that i didnt know.CT calls me to come out and i went.I tell her that i didnt saw anything.She told me to drop the act and calls me out and says that she's disappointed in me for doing this and believed that i wouldn't do this.She went on and said she doesnt need to hear me say anything and told me to go and tell my friend to bring the phone to her.I couldnt really come back from that.She said that she will let this matter go under the radar of the higher ups if we resolve this now.She offers to not bring any backlash if he just admits it.I decided ill talk to him and she called him out.I talked to him and let him know the situation and He still admits that he didn't bring it but now she asks where is it(My dude actually hid the phone somewhere before the class started).She looks at me and says ""i thought you said you knew"".At that point i knew i got played and i deserved it.I pointed out that i didnt know it was hidden.She says that doesnt matter.Me and the other classmates that were called spoke to him that its better to admit it and told him that she would let it slide.He agrees and tells her that he will personally bring it to her and to Keep her end of the word.The teacher was still pissed at me cuz i lied to her face knowing i saw the phone but she misunsderstood me knowing that i knew where it was hidden.So all's well and no one knows right? Wrong.The Events about to happen did it for me.


So the next day like normal ,  i go upto my friend and he proceeds to ignore me.I asked him whats wrong and he just replies angrily and tells me to f off.I knew that something was up.So A lets me know that there's a rumourgoing around that apparently i was the one who snitched on my friend and got him caught.I went upto my friend and told him that this is all false and told him the truth of what happened and he tells me that he tells me to f off again and to not see him again.He punches me in the face and i didnt fought back and let it go.Next day he starts talking trash about me behind my back.Everybody starts avoiding me now.The only one who really talked to me at that time was A.She told me that this was for the better and   it was about time that i stepped out of that relationship with him.It turns out that the rumour about him ctually smoking and stuff were real and The other guys he went out with to smoke actually confirmed this because they would talk to her and other girls about this because they thought that being addicted to smoking was some kind if talent that women would become wet for.They would ocassionally go out to drink and so on.I could trust this because it was told to me by A who trusted me to keep this truth a secret.Why would she let me know something fake and tell me to not let anyone know?.I kept my word and never ever talked to him ever again.It was like a weight was lifted from back but of course nothing ends well.He proceeds to be toxic to me whenever we get near each other and one day we got into a fight.I didnt pull any punches and let him have it.That was the first ever proper fight i got into and stupid enough it was with the guy who couldnt even talk for me when shit got rough.Fortunately the teachers werent called on.(I Understood later that the bully i slapped last year was actually one of his smoke buddies.He knew secrets about him that i didnt know about and that was why he didnt come to help me that time).I told him that ive had enough of this and we were done with this.I didnt talk to him after this.

The final exams were coming up.I was talking to A and she talked about how everyone avoids me even now because the rumours about my ex-friend has taken its toll on my status aswell.They all think im weird and proceeds to ignore me.What made me cry was there was a birthday party a while ago of one of our classmates and the only one invited was me.Everyone knew about the incident and they also believed that i snitched on him when it was just a lie to make me get hate.I hated everyone at that point and i was relieved to have A by my side.I eventually mustered up the courage to ask her out one day but before i could she says she can't talk to me anymore because the people now are targeting her because of me.At this moment i thought about ending it all there.I couldnt even think about not talking to her ever again so i hoped we could talk on the phone or chat but it didnt really work out.I eventually became the loner i was before.Everyone in the classroom became as toxic as the people last year.People from other class(they were with my ex-friend now)would ambush me outside the class and bully me.I didnt want to retaliate because i knew that would be bad for me so i seeked help from teachers but nobody really cared.They had the nerve to say that they will stop if you dont retaliate.Not even my parents belived me.They said it was because i was provoking them.I tried to reach out to other students but no surprise nobody wanted to help me.I eventually gave up trying and took the pain.Thinking back , it was really painful.It was more painful because it was for something i didnt even do.


So its march ,im 17 now and final exams were about to end but thats when mr covid came to say hi.That was when the financial problems came up again.Up until this point , me and my family could manage barely with the money we had but the virus just made it really worse.My mom was constantly in fights with my dad because he didnt want to get a job(ikr what a nice dad).It wasnt impossible to get a job here during the virus.


5 months passed , I finished the postponed exams.Results came in.I got '98% in 'grades(I worked hard damn it)I had nothing to do so i got a part time job at a new bakery that opened near us.The daily pay was really low but at the time i didnt have a choice.One day i came back from work and i see mom crying on the floor with blood coming from her lips.I rushed towards her and it seems she got into a fight with my dad.She said she has had enough(there were many other problems that led upto this but it all revolved around money).She said she wanted a divorce and it was all back and forth from that.My dad yells at me for not making enough to support our family.I was speechless.Look at his audacity to question me and my hard work when he doesnt want to get a job himself.I said to thank god that you were my father.(i legit wanted to punch him so hard).We eventually calmed down and i haven't really talked to him since.I was in disbelief that all of this was really happening so i called A(I actually called her and we talked after the finals result)  because i believed that there were no problems to her talking with me now.She didnt pick the phone.I tried to call again.Same result.I sent her a message and she didnt respond.Ive waited a couple of days.I eventually gave up.
She eventually replied she didnt notice.We talked for a bit and but she hanged up without responding to my call for help.Deep down i knew that she didnt want to talk.


A month ago,
I get a call from CT and she invited me to a get together of our class.I was happy to attend and i did.They all enjoyed the gathering , took photos , and so on.I didnt bother being a part of that.To be honest i actually went there so i could be alone and take my mind of things so it was actually a great opportunity to have some peace.I saw A there and went to talk to her.She avoids me again.I was growing bored of this cat&amp;mouse chase so i asked whats the problem with her and she tells me to back off.I decided that this wont go anywhere so i didnt take it any further so i left.



Present Day,
Nothing has changed really.Im still alone here knowing nothing about what to do with my life.Ive found this subreddit while scrolling around and i just wanted to know if what i did was right?.Thats all i wanted to know.Rather than that nobody talks to me now.Not even family.Ive been thinking about ending it now.I cant see a way to get out of this shitshow.",depression,What Am i Supposed To Do Here?,Early Life,
1,"hello. i have a problem that grew in me for years and became too much lately. 

(sorry for my english) (tw: suicide, rape, abuse)

im a very empathetic person and since i remember it makes my life a struggle. i was diagnosed with a depression, anxiety and bpd as a teenager (im 28 now) and through the years i like to say i got better cause i worked hard (im also on right meds). but there are things that also got worse for me. 

when i was an angsty teen i used to read and watch terrible stuff on the internet and i mean even the dark web level kind of stuff. why? i have no idea. it was unpleasant and i would say traumatic. in that time of my life i saw and read about the worse things that people are able to do to another being. when i realized how many vulnerable kids and animals are abused and raped daily something broke in me and its getting worse and worse. 

i remind myself about the dark reality all of sudden, more and more often, in the weirdest situations. i have visions in my head that are terrible and i cant ignore them. my heart is pounding, my throat is closing and tears coming to my eyes. and the realization that i cant help and save make my mind weaker and weaker. i was always suicidal but because of that i got worse again and started to think about suicide daily (and i was free from that for like three years). 

i have no idea how to deal with this. i tried to desensitize by educating myself more and more on the subject, take it as a simple reality that i need to accept, but it doesnt help. i like to call myself an activist, i do everything i can to make things in this world better but its always not enough so singing petitions and donating money dont help either. and im tired. cause no matter how hard i try to help its still a drop in an ocean.

any ideas how to deal with it? i appreciate your time and thank you.",depression,Cruelty towards animals and children make me wanna kms (trigger warnings),Early Life,
1,"I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety for the majority of my teenage years and early adulthood (21 now). I started to struggle when my life at home started to deteriorate. My dad, who likes to drink had started to become increasingly aggressive to me, he would blow up over anything, threaten to kick me out, or try to intimidate me or just yelling verbal abuse at me every chance he got. I felt very self conscious and truth be told, I started to believe everything he would say and it really took it’s toll on me. I began to withdraw myself from my friends at school as I had become extremely anxious. I missed more and more days of school as my attendance had always been great before instead choosing to stay at home and lock myself away in my room sleeping and watching YouTube so that I could avoid my dad and the world. Soon after this I sank further into depression as my gran died. This broke me completely and my mum, who has been the best mom I could ever ask for was shattered by the lose of her mum. At home it began to seem evident that as I would stay in my room for the majority, my dad had turned his anger to my mum...although never being violent towards her, he would try to make her feel like shit and put her down, then sometimes act like nothing ever happened. It was horrible to see that my mum who always defended me against him, was now becoming the recipient of his anger and I felt guilty for not doing anything but terrified of the consequences if I tried to intervene. My mum does everything for us, works full time and takes care of my grandad and is not argumentative in the slightest. I could see that the stress was taking its toll on her. Yet as her husband it seemed like he was only interested in pilling on more stress and making the house a very toxic and uneasy place to be. 
During this period I began to think that it would be easier to just not be here anymore as I couldn’t escape my all this stress, negativity, anxiety and had no motivation for anything. 

This went on for a few years until I eventually finished school and racked up the motivation and decided to get a job, and start trying seeing my friends again to combat my shitty home life although many had moved on with their lives, I was grateful that there were still a group that I felt wanted me around.
Things were starting to look up, despite life at home still being miserable.
Even though I had a job now, which I was able to keep myself together for, I would still feel anxious and stressed, sometimes over the littlest things. My grandads health has now started to deteriorate, and my mums health seems to be getting worse as well and she’s still having to put up with my dads shit. She had asked him for to leave but he refused and when she asked him for a divorce, he told her that she would have to sell the house, something my mum can’t afford to do.

I had also I plucked up the courage to ask out a girl I had liked for sometime. I fell for her way harder than I could of imagined and this only grew as we started to see more of each other which was difficult as the pandemic took over everything. 
Whenever we were together I loved it but I couldn’t help but feel anxious and stressed that she would call it quits after a while.
It eventually happened a couple months back and it has hit hard, just a few weeks before it I had been signed off my work due to anxiety and stress after breaking down in work and since then I have spiralled back into a deep depression which I can’t seem to shake and all I seem to have is negative thoughts, whether it be about worrying about my mum, grandad, the future, thinking about the girl I dated. It’s so overwhelming and I feel that I am such a burden on my friends who have their own stuff going on and I don’t want to constantly hassle them about how miserable I am and my mum who already has enough on her plate without having to deal with my problems and doesn’t need anymore stress. I have now fallen behind with my college course and yet I know it, I can’t seem to find the motivation to even get out of bed and do daily activities. The prospect of interacting with people is so daunting and makes me anxious, even with my friends.
I have never been so low and I can’t help but dwell on everything that has happened. I am now on anti-depressants which I was always reluctant to use, have been really struggling to sleep and having panic attacks when I get stressed.
Waking up each day just doesn’t seem worth it.

I’ve never really spoken about this to anyone so I’ve decided to just let it all out here since no one will know who I really am. It’s crazy to think that I’ve been struggling with depression since I was a kid. My cousins took advantage of me and my innocence. They molested me and threaten if I ever spoke up no one would believe me. One did things to me when I was only 5 another cousin when I was 8 and the last when I was 10. When I was 11 my grandma passed away from cancer and I could never cope with it and still can’t to this day. Then comes a different part of my life. I was going to start middle school/jr high with no friends bc I was bullied by my “friends” in elementary. At 14 I made friends with the wrong crowd and was taking ecstasy as a cry out for help. One time I had taken 5 pills and mix it with tequila ready to just end my life even tho I didn’t know that’s what I was doing. At the same time I began take those pills I was discovering my sexuality. I was at my rock bottom but I was able to pick myself up.

I tried so hard to make friends hs but for some reason everyone hated me. Maybe they knew about my drug addiction? Who knows. I was jumped my junior year and suspended from school for it. I met my first gf ever and I was happy for the first time in a long time or so I thought. She cheated on me and verbally and physically abused me. I tried to dead my life again but didn’t succeed. I graduated hs and my family was so proud of me but I saw myself as a failure. I tried to go to college and took a few classes but the fear of not being able to make friends and feeling alone scared me too much so I dropped out and disappointment my parents. 

I started working and thought everything was going well for me but then I started drinking every single night in my room by myself. I then started working in a theme park and made a few friends working there and even found someone I fell for. She was out and wanted to keep it a secret and which is exactly what my first gf did and I agreed to it but then it started again. I was being manipulated and abused by her. She made me believe she was the only one there for me and my friends weren’t my friends but when my grandfather passed away she was nowhere to be found and my friends were there for me. The relationship was very toxic and we decided we were better off as friends with benefits but even then she was horrible to me. One night she told me I made the relationship up in my head and what we had never happened. That’s when I knew it was time to ended everything. She made me feel like I was going crazy and I was drinking a lot more and tried to kill myself again but I couldn’t do it bc I thought about me causing my family so much pain.

Months later I download tinder and met someone and we just clicked. I fell so hard for her and then I drove out to see her almost 2hrs away from my place. I was so happy but I knew in order for it to work one of us had to move so I decided I would do it and so I did. I left everything behind and I was depressed again. All the friends I had made stopped talking to me I had no one at here and I was having a hard time getting a job. She was able to get me a job where she work but I wasn’t happy. I got a job somewhere else and I was so happy. I thought I would be able to make friends in this city but I was wrong. I was treated (still am) like an outsider. No one made me feel welcomed instead they all judged me for being a lesbian and made little comments and gossiped behind my back even went as far as started a group chat to talk about me. 

And now we’re here. Im all alone and can’t talk to anyone about my problems because I feel like no one will understand me. I live in a city where I barely know how to get around and don’t have any friends I can run to for advice or just to hang out with.

But not for me, in fact, I was lucky to be born in a family that has enough resources for me to grow up with everything I needed and more. 

My problem starts in school, when I was little I was the typical nerdy fat guy that everyone made fun of so my social skills are not that good because of that, and I developed social anxiety and depressive tendencies. When I grew up and hit puberty suddenly I was what many girls would consider good looking so girls started talking to me, I started a few relationships out of need for love but I was used horribly and my social anxiety worsened, I started showing signs of depression, every morning getting out of my bed started being really really hard, everything started to bore me and nothing really felt nice or fun anymore, it was like the world started to lose color.

Fast forward a few years. When I got out of school I passed an exam to get to the best university of Colombia, I decided to become a doctor because a) I didn't know what to do with my life and b) I thought that if I helped people at least my life would be worth something. That gave me some kind of prupouse and I thought I would get better. But nothing got better, in fact it got worse, two years studying medicine just worsened my condition because of the stress, my family thought I was happy but I have never been worse, this year I didn't do shit, I wasn't able to enter classes because it felt so heavy,I didn't study, I didn't even do exams and now I lost my student capacity in that university, I felt so free, but my family is now constantly reminding me of that failure now.

Now I don't know what to do, I don't have any particular talent, I don't have anything that makes me happy, my life just feels like such a waste of everything and neverending boredom, my drive to do anything is non-existent, I lost all my friends because of my social anxiety, and I feel so lost and alone, I really don't know what to do.",depression,I don't know what to do,Early Life,

1,"A little context, I have ptsd. I was sexually abused, raped, beaten, sexually assaulted, and neglected for three years by my cousin who was a teenager at the time. I’m currently in a legal battle regarding it. I told people who I shouldn’t have, so literally everyone my high school knows, I’ve gotten into fights because I get bullied for it. 50 flashbacks a day, sleep paralysis every night, self hate, self doubt, depression, disgust, confusion, shame, everything. I’ve felt it and still do. I tried hanging myself about two months ago, failed, and tried slitting my own wrists, failed at that too but I was close hah. I’ve attempted to kill myself 5 times now. I was taken to the hospital and stayed there for a week or so. There are several rumors that I lied about my trauma and am pressing charges just for money. My court case is going awfully, my life is shit.


So yesterday... I remember one crucial thing. A camera. He filmed it. Guess what that means? Not only did my cousin use me like that while I was there, he filmed it so that memory would cement in his mind and he could get off on me again and again. “Oh I’m not babysitting Christian today? I’ll just pull up the tape from yesterday”... Knowing that there’s most likely pedophiles that have used *me* to get off makes me feel gross and I fucking hate myself.

There’s no fucking light at the end of the tunnel. The abuse started when I was fucking 8 man. And now my parents are pissed at me because every time I get asked a question on the stand I break down crying or get too confused and then it looks like I’m lying...

There's a bit of me that understands why I behaved that way because they were very abusive towards me from a young age. There's another bit that feels like I should ""get over"" the way they treated me because they've become nicer in the last 3 years but clearly I can't especially because they're almost entirely to blame for my depression/mood disorders which have, to put it plainly, ruined my life. I feel like I'm being irrational and needlessly hostile because I'm usually quite level headed when it comes to speaking about how I feel towards them.

I want to be healthier, quit smoking, fuck I want to do some yoga right now but I can’t get up. It just feels like I’m not in control of my body anymore. I don’t want to burden my partner with my sadness, I don’t want to get triggered everytime I’m even reminded of my family. 
I’ve gone many miles away from my family and yet it feels like their words and actions echo in my head. Like I never left them at all. I hate them. I can’t get far enough from them, how dare they treat me like shit for 20 years and think that it’s ok. How dare they make me apologize to them for ‘causing stress on the family’ after I was honest and open about my depression. I sincerely cannot wrap my head around the fact that they have no desire to understand me and who I am. Why do I have to apologize to people who think that I am a (and these these next words are an exact quote) “druggy slut who has no future.” In fact my mother has even asked me why she even gave birth to me. 
I know I wasn’t the best student, but I was sad long before that. I wasn’t allowed to have any interests of my own, everytime I liked something or someone it was “don’t like that”. Essentially, my family and brother included used to gang up on me and bully me at home emotionally. Constantly making fun of me. I was never the star child. My big brother was, so he was always a ‘parental figure’ in the family. Or at least he saw himself that way the way he bossed me around. He even exploited me sexually which is one of the darker chapters in my life that took me a total of 6 years to even talk about. And all they cared about was my grades. And since my grades were bad, well they just abused me more and more and more until I shut myself off and left. 
My therapist told me that sometimes people won’t change, and that distance would help. She taught me how to cope and how to fight these thoughts. I wish I had someone to talk to about this. I don’t want to tell my partner about these thoughts because I’ve told him why I’m sad before and I don’t want to be a broken record. I don’t know.

1,"Sometimes I just don't understand how I can be so unlucky and miserable with my life, it's ridiculous every time I think about it.

Since I live in Taiwan and my parents have been sending me to meaningless cram school to prepare for the entry exam for junior high school, I basically have all my time studying since I was like fking 10 years old. Now that I think about it, I have never had a close friend and let alone a girlfriend. And it all just because I spent all my time studying school bs and having completely no entertainment at all. 

And finally, after all my hard work studying fk 10 hrs a day for the entry exam, I got in the dream school (for my parents not for me). My classmates inside that school were all very mean. I was called 'piece of shit' every single day, and I dared not saying anything back, because I felt that would make them bully me even more. Also there were multiple classmates who would hit me or laugh at me whenever I did something they didn't agree with. 

And I suppose the main reason they bullied me was because of my fking miserable height 160cm (about 5'3) which is like the lowest 1% for Taiwanese male. I lacked confidence doing anything since then including talking to a girl. Before university, I have never hanged out with a girl even as a group.

After my miserable secondary school life, I was finally in university and got out of the control of my parents. And with massive luck and my own effort, I had several friends and a very close female friend(my girlfriend later on). All of a sudden, the fking Chinese virus showed up and ruined everything. I was forced to have a long distance relationship with her and things didn't work out. Therefore, I probably lose the only chance I will ever have such an intimate relationship with someone for a stupid pandemic.

Sum up the story, I have always had no friend since my parents forced me to study for something I am not interested in. Then in secondary school, I found out the fact that I have a pathetic height and I was bullied for whatever reason. Then after all that and my parents kept telling me I could have a happy life once I got into a great uni, and in reality I don't due to the fking virus ruining everything.

And now, I am extremely introverted, lack of confidence, lonely af and don't have any hope for my future.

1,"I want to preface this by apologizing for the length of the post. As an amateur writer, I’ve often struggled with writing out beginnings. I don’t mean to answer any big questions, or offer any kind of advice. I simply want to share my two insignificant cents on my experience with depression.
My earliest recollection of being aware that I was at an imbalance was in a ninth grade English class. I forget what the assignment was about but I remember being pulled aside by the teacher and telling me that whatever I wrote had alarmed her to the point of notifying a social worker. I thought it strange that I had to go through this, but in hindsight it helped explain a lot. After meeting with the social worker and being asked a few questions regarding the stability of my psyche, I was diagnosed depressed. This actually became news to me. I figured everyone felt the way I had at some point in their lives. In other words I guess everyone felt hopeless at times. But I guess my issues went a bit above that. And to top it off the social worker said my folks would be notified of what had just transpired. My initial thought was “Fuck.” It’s been unnerving having to speak with my parents about my mental health. So you can imagine my surprise to come home to find my intermediate family members sitting in a circle in the the living room. What followed was like an intervention-everyone telling me what I mean to them, the significance of living and existing. You get it. All I could think was how the social worker did me dirty. 
In the years that followed I’ve been on a roller coaster with my depression. Was able to mange it with physical activity. (I was in cross country/track all throughout high school and continue to run.) To having periods of simply drinking my days away. Being on antidepressants, being off antidepressants. Talking to various therapists to trying to handle things on my own. Meditating in order to find inner solace, to attempting suicide once.
For me depression is a good friend. I love them, but sometimes they overstay their welcome. I struggle with it everyday, Somedays are better than others. What gets me through is simply the drive to move forward despite the meaninglessness of it all. I’m a little bleep in a vast radar.

Prior to college I never experienced any of the usual milestones of teenagehood. I never went to a party, I didn't had friends to hang out and do stupid things with. I don't have any fun stories or wild memories because all I ever did was go to school, go back home, sit in front of a computer screen for hours daydreaming about living a normal life like all the other kids. It was around this time I came to terms with being trans, and ever since the feeling of being an alien unlike everyone else consumes me.

College wasn't that different, I remained living at home with my parents. I didn't do anything either, I just went to college and then back home to my computer. I was still the quiet creep who doesn't speak to anyone. By a miracle I got an internship, but I couldn't keep working there after graduating, and 4 years later that remains my only job experience.

I was dealing with depression since I was 14. I always knew something was wrong but I couldn't think of anything that serious. It became worse and worse but I was dealing with it in a way. I was distracted by many things (school, parents, friends etc etc.)

It instantly led to an eatind disorder after a year. Now I had a huge awful feeling that causes an ED and then the cycle goes on like that for 6 years and more. 

Then I went to uni in another country. I was living alone now. No parents nothing. I thought I was fine at first. The first 1 and a half month. I had some friends who I instantly talked about my past and sad lifestory.

It suddenly went downhill. My ED was at its worse and my depression became so intense that I was suicidal at that point. My friends were dead worried. They talked about how I need an ACTUAL therapist and naybe medication. I didnt listen for a while but then I realized that I was actually going to die and felt like shit. 

I was constantly sad and crying and depressed and I was dead worried that I was going to lose my only friends cause of this shitty stuff.

1,"A little bit of backstory 1st.

My father was a drug addict and my mom couldn't take care of me as she could barley afford to live on her own so I had to stay with my grandparents . my grandfather died when I was around 8 and I was there when he passsed away on the couch (he died from stomach cancer) he was like a father to me when my real father wasn't there. 

Fast forward a couple years in now in middle school. It was around this time when i met my best friend. She felt like the 1st real friend I ever had in my life i was always a introverted and very shy around people but for some reason I felt safe around her she was the 1st person I told i was suicidal. It was also around this time in middle school when i was sexually violated by 2 other students at 2 seperate times one male the other female. (It was also around this time my mother got custody of me) 


My friend meant the absolute world to me I loved her more then anything else. She was there for my 1st suicide attempt she was there when i 1st started cutting. And on return I would be there whenever she needed me whenever she went through a breakup I was there for her i would even carry her stuff for her when she needed it. I felt as tho she was the only reason I needed to live.

Then in high school everything changed she started pretending I didn't exist when she hung around certain people whenever i tried talking to her she would get pissed at me for seemingly no reason. 

After about 3 months of her acting like this I just went off yelling at her in the empty school hallway there was nothing more then that just yelling then after a short while I stormed off thinking out friendship was over.
The next year or so was nothing but pure hell. The next day she had told everyone that I had tried to rape her and that I had her by the throat against the lockers which wasn't true at all as I never even put my hands on her.


The entire next year was me getting harassed and beaten over shit i didnt even do. I would get confronted by her friends almost every single week one time they threw basket balls at my head the next I was being beaten against the bathroom stall. 


All of this also lead to a police investgation over her rape claims however the charges were dropped when she addmitted to lying. It also lead to my then girlfriend at the time breaking up with me as she believed her lies. The only people who believed me were the teachers who i was now staying after class with until the hallway cleared for fear of being confronted or beaten up by somone. All of this was made worse by the fact that all of this was being done to me by someone i loved more then anything else in the world. 

This all lead to me trying to overdose on sleeping pills come begining of the summer which obviously didn't work. It also lead to me getting PTSD now something as simple as hearing her name makes it hard for me to breathe. Ive encountered her a few times since then and every time has ended badly just seeing her leads to me having a panic attack. 


I tried talking to my mither about this to which she said she doesn't think to which she just said ""I don't think you should be upset or even mad at her shes just a girl"". 


Now I'm sitting here 2 years later lonely no friends no girlfriend my birthdays coming up and I made a deal with myself saying how if things didn't get better i was gonna buy a gun and shoot myself.

i've never really had a close friend, only people who are a bit more than aquaintances. i've never had someone to have sleepovers with are hang out with outside of school. until the 7th grade i met this girl, Ava. she was a good friend sometimes i hung out with her outside of school but not often, she wasn't really social. i wanted her to be my ideal best friend you see on tv. frequent sleepovers, hanging out often, talking on the phone etc. she didn't like to do that stuff. i'd find myself begging her to do it sometimes. fast forward just over 2 years she started to ignore me which isn't the first time. and a month of ignoring me later she says ""i don't think our relationship is healthy"" which is not all she said but that is the most important. we stopped being friends. so my one close friend i had for 2.5 years was out of my life for good. this was a month ago.

this left me devastated. i comtemplated scuicide, running away. in my head i had no one but my family which has problems i won't get into. during this quarentine i had no plausible way of finding friends and even if there wasn't coronavirus i wouldn't be able to find friends because everyone my age already have best friends.

i feel worse than i have ever felt before. now everything i do feels like i'm doing it for no reason. i feel like there is nothing left me to do here. i feel like if i die nothing will change or happen. i feel like my exististance doesn't matter. i don't know. after writing this my mind is blank.",depression,i have absolutely no friends and it's slowly killing me,Early Life,

1,"Recently I went in for a physical, along with talking about a very concerning symptom I experienced when I was going through an interview. For a period of time I snapped out of reality, and then came too, realized time had passed, and it even took a couple seconds to gain control if myself again. The doctor thinks I may be suffering form petit grand mal seizures, and I think he may be right.

Thinking back over my childhood and past, I realized that there have been numerous lapses in time where I don't remember anything. With the majority being cases of being in class, and being yelled at for not paying attention, or not remembering what was just said. Then the wreck I had I blacked out, I was tired and my mother has been pressuring me into thinking I fell asleep. When the truth is I don't think I did, I remember the sensation as being not of sleep, but of stepping out of reality into a back void, then coming to and that's when I wrecked my car. It happened another time when I was working a different job, where I kept slipping in and out of consciousness. With at one point almost wrecking, yet I didn't given I fought against losing consciousness, and pulled over to gather myself. 

None of this is normal, yet it's all my fault and I'm causing it according to my mother. Which is really stressing me out, and making me feel like I want this to happen apparently. When I don't, it's scary and makes me feel like a ticking time bomb at times. I'm scheduled to see a neurologist, and I'm hoping to get some answers, yet I can't but help feel depressed and anxious over the situation. 

For all I know I am indeed crazy and I'm causing all of this somehow. On the other I'm not, and I have a serious neurological condition which could seriously impact my life. I just don't know what to do at this point, I just want to feel normal,yet I feel like a freak as put by my own family given I'm causing this on purpose.",depression,I feel like a freak,Early Life,
1,"I been sexual molested, treating like trash, and verbally abused by my family. 

I don't even know where to start. Maybe even since I was born then. My mom and (her mother in law) my grandma have internal conflict. But it weird like my mom told me my grandma is traditional type whereas she hate to have granddaughter but doted on grandsons more. Thus, my mom send me to the baby sitters house.  My grandma perspective, she say my mom don't like my grandma and that why my mom didn't allow my grandma to take care of me.  (typical asian mother in lawdrama). My grandma told me I was sexually  molested and treated poorly.  This place, I guess I rememebr I was lock in the toilet whole day. But what fuck up is, my grandma proceeded to keep silent abt this and my mother know abt what happening but allow it to go on from I was 3 years old to 6 years old. I'm 23 now I trying to forget all this but everytime they would force me to go my grandparent hosue to joke abt my trauma.  They always talk how wonderful they time when they take care of my brothers. Excluding me cuz I was babysitting hell. Of course I would feel like shit. 

In addition, I not allow to go out, talk to boys, constantly clean after my families. I remember there one time I befriended a boy. My mom beat the shit out of me and had me kneeling in front her bed the whole night. Even now I'm 23, I still cleaning after the family but now I crave for freedom like to jsut hangout with my friend and stuff. Or pursue my hobby or career.  My mom would throw a fit and argue with me with I didn't go along with her plans. Like studying the course she choose, doesn't allow me to work,  lock me at home, even threaten me scissor at my thoart. 

I in a constant stupid emotional feeling where I hate it what they did to me but I can't help to love them as well cuz their my family. I wish they would be more understanding   Its so frustrating even I try so much to suppress my feelings. I tho of killing myself because I feel the what make me happy.

I work maybe 3 days a week and I'm already at my limit. I'm not ready to work a 9-5 job for the rest of my life. I have no ""friends"" just people that use me as a last resort because they are bored. I'm overweight as fuck family problems up the ass (not the people in my house) I cant wait til retirement to have a life. My friends keep ditching me because I don't play the way they want me to. They ditched me because I'm just a tool to fill the last member on the team. 5 left me and not one felt bad and stayed with me. Its not the first time it has happened. 

When I'm like this I think about whats I would leave if I killed myself and it always narrows down to personal belongings and family. No friends no classmates nothing. Just fake people who pretend to care when I'm dead. I can only imagine the assembly of my death at my school. All the people sad and wondering why I did it. Ik this is all morbid and depressing but my head is just not it right now. 

Ik this sounds pathetic but the main thing that kept me going was porn. When pornhub deleted over 10 million videos that were from unverified accounts. I've had nothing to watch that I enjoyed. I literally just do it now out of habit. It doesn't even make me happy.

After years of mental and verbal abuse. My issues treated like they weren’t a big deal emotionally neglected and ignored. Treated like shit threatened with violence. Suffering loss after loss. Why is it my responsibility to get help. How come I have to help myself. Especially coming from my parents who caused the issues I already suffered from clinical MMD and they added anxiety and panic disorder along with worsening my depression. And then after being mocked insulted and straight up threatened by my sperm donor(lost the title of dad long ago) my mom just let it happen(don’t blame her too much she’s non confrontational and timid) but I’m told the only way to get better is to help myself. Fuck that. Why should I have to work to do that when it’s others who made me like this why should I have to put financial stress on myself to pay for all of it. I’m living just long enough to spit on my sperm donors grave when he’s gone.

1,"Sorry if this is not the right sub but I have just been feeling a lot of guilt lately over past actions. I just need someone to talk some of these events out rationally. Whenever I start to feel happy or proud I will just remember these events and feel horrible about myself. I have not been diagnosed with depression or anything, but any time I am alone with my thoughts I will obsess over these mistakes. Here are my biggest regrets:

1. In middle school there was this autistic kid. I was in a friend group. Initially I started to talk to him in class a little bit, and he would sit at our lunch table. We would talk to him and stuff, but I think we might have been making fun of him. I think I thought we were just being his friends, but sometimes we would get him to do stuff that is inappropriate. For example, my friend made him call one of the teachers at our school a bitch. Initially, I laughed and went along with it. I don't remember specifically trying to get him to do anything, but I was definitely involved. After thinking about it, I realized this was bad and tried to get our group to stop making him do this stuff and just be friends with him. I talked to him about it once, to tell him to stop listening to my friend group, but I don't think he understands it. I think he likes the attention it gives him. After that, I genuinely tried to be friendly to him, I sat by him in a class, I gave him hi-fives in the hallway, etc. But I still feel bad about what happened. This may be my biggest regret.
2. In middle school I made fun of this person who was 'weird'. In cross country, me and a couple friends would make fun of him. One day I made fun of him for having a boner, and I saw him walk away looking sad. I felt really bad right after I said it. I went over and talked to him and tried to make him feel better. I don't remember exactly what happened but I remember he said he doesn't have a lot of friends and that he is sad. I tried to make him feel better and encourage him. I was nice to him ever since then, giving him words of encouragement. This year, in high school, I sat by him in class and am his partner. He still has low self-esteem and seems to doubt himself, but I try to give him words of encouragement. I still feel horrible about what I put him through, though. 
3. In middle school, I made fun of another person once in gym class. I made fun of him for 'copying' me and a friend (idk why). That is the only instance I can remember being mean to his face. Also, he would be a partner to my friend in class and I would try to get my friend to stop being friends with this person. This one wasn't the worst thing I have done to a person, but I feel bad for never apologizing or making it up to this person. I did kind of try in 8th grade, but I saw him drawing nazi symbols. I then thought I was justified for being mean to him since he is doing bad things, but I still don't think I am. 
4. In elementary school, I liked this girl who just came to our school. I don't remember what I did, I think I told people that she liked my friend or something, in any case I made her cry and she told the teacher. I was really mad at her for doing that at the time, and I talked bad about her behind her back. It was a weird situation though, because I still liked her. We became friends in 5th grade kind of. I think I did apologize to her right after, but I didn't mean it. I feel bad for making her cry.
5. In middle school one of my friends was dating a girl. Our friend group didn't like her, so we tried to get him to break up with her. I don't think we were ever mean to the girls face, we just didn't like her for some reason. In fact, I was always nice when I talked to her, but mean behind her back. My friend actually didn't break up with her for a while though, partially out of spite I think. Afterwards I did feel bad and was nicer to her. I still feel bad about the whole thing though. I don't think she knows what we did behind her back.
6. In middle school we tried to get this guy out of our friend group. We didn't like him for some reason. I wasn't mean to his face, but eventually he did leave. However, other people in my group were making fun of him I think and he started crying at lunch. I felt bad for him and talked to him while he was crying. I think I made him feel better, but I feel bad about trying to kick him from the group. He doesn't hang out with the group anymore.

Thank you for reading this whole thing. As you probably noticed, my 'friend group' was involved in a lot of these regrets. I no longer associate with this group, as I now know they are pretty mean to people. I stopped hanging out with them at the end of middle school, but the regret from that time still lasts. 

The guilt and regret I feel are tough. I can't focus on things sometimes, it is always at the back of my mind. I obsess over these a lot. I can't stand feeling like a bad person. I feel like all of my accomplishments are just going to waste since I don't deserve them and they are ruined by a permanent stain. 

If possible, can someone discuss with me at least some of these regrets? I think I would feel better if I could just talk these through with someone.",depression,Guilt and Regret,Early Life,
1,"It has been quite a few years of major sadness for me. some soul-crushing

My mentor that I have known for 15 years died in Aug 2013. He was the one I talked to because my father didn't talk to me. It was a hard blow. He was a friend, a father figure and a mentor. He talked to me about everything. He wrote me a letter before he died telling me good stuff about myself. He always stuck up for me. It was a real hard lose him.

my father died on Dec 7 2013. We were estranged for 10 years. we saw each other 2 weeks before he died. It was really hard because he wasn't the dad I had known all my life. He had a new wife that had two daughters that were married and had kids. I never wanted kids and I wasn't married so it was easy to let me go. He still talked to my sister and brother. The last advice he gave me was to do the best with what I have and don't focus on what I don't have like a relationship with him. The hardest part of this is that I was daddy's little girl. when I was old enough I went to work with him with his construction business. I worked for him for 10 years. we used to go out and do things all the time when he was married to my mother but when he got remarried he didn't want to do anything without his girlfriend which pissed me off because we used to always have daddy/ daughter day even in my 20's. I am 50 now and it still hurts because I saw his new wife's daughter at my father's grave and I got jealous that he picked them over me.

In August 2016 my other mentor from work died. We were real close and work together for 17 years in the same department. I caught to see him two days before he died. This is another really hard one for me. He was my friend. We made up plans that we would run the department and the two of us were unstoppable.

In Dec of 2016, my grandmother died. I used to visit her weekly and she would make me lunch. I had a really special connection with my grandmother. I was the only one to help her with bills and shopping. I would read her, her mail. I would do all of her paperwork for Medicaid and social security. I saw her more than her own children did. I found her unresponsive in her bed and we call the ambulance. When she went into a nursing house I would visit twice a week so she wouldn't be lonely.

In March 2018 my dog died. that was very hard to handle because I had to put him down after having him for 15 years.

In 2018 my uncle died.

In 2019 my aunt died. My mother and I would go over for company and play go fish. When she went to the nursing home we used to visit. I was close to this aunt growing up and I always wanted to be like her. She was my dad's only sister.

In April 2019 my cousin died of an OD. he was only 28 years old I tried to help him get help but he wouldn't listen. I would have him work for me for extra money. He was the kid I babysat when I was a kid. I posted his funeral on Facebook and my uncle got so mad at me he disowned me. He said he didn't want any of my cousins' druggie friends coming to the funeral. well, 5 people show up. they were friends of my cousin since childhood and one girl that he used to date. There were no druggies at the funeral. but my uncle didn't care and now doesn't speak to me. I lost my cousin as well as my uncle that day.

Spt 2019 my fiance of 10 years said he wants to move to Florida. We didn't live together because I worked in live around Boston and he lived in NH.  He didn't like his job anymore and I guess he wanted a change. We talked about getting a vacation home in Virginia but Florida never came up.  He told me in September he was moving to Florida and he was gone a month later. I broke up with him. I could do long distance from Mass to Florida that's ridiculous. I told him he ought to move in with me but he wanted the sun. Now he lives in a senior living community trailer park in the middle of Florida. Not even by the water. ( he's a big fisherman). He calls me to come down all the time. he wants to get back together and he wants me to move to Florida. A little about me. I own a house with my sister that will be paid off in 8.5 years. I live 2 blocks away from my mother. I have been working for the same company for over 22 years and I was planning on retiring with that company. I worked hard to get my seniority and I don't want to lose it. Plus I love my job and boss. Was I supposed to love him more and move my whole life for him? If I don't live in my house my sister couldn't afford it.

After we broke up after that first week his family unfriended me on Facebook and the kids didn't talk to me. I thought we had a good thing but I must have been wrong. I was always good to the kids and always put them first.

In Dec  2019 my sister and my niece got into a fight. My niece and her daughter lived with us. Well, the fight was so bad they left and never came back. I help raise my niece and that was the main reason for getting the house. So we could all be together. It was my sister's fault for the fight and now my niece wants nothing to do with us.

I feel like a lost all the good people that genuinely loved me and that I like and respected. I feel so lonely after losing this many people that I was close to. The holidays are hard. I just think of all the people I miss. 

I take my dog out for a walk and I am crying the whole time. I go down to the cemetery to see my family.

My life is a total mess, I've come to think I can't be fixed, Im totally worthless, all I do turns out wrong. I don't want to die nor do I wish to be dead, I just wish I could feel truly happy.

My parents don't help. My mom is very mean most of the times, 50% I'll say, the other 25% she feels like a true loving mother and the other 25% se feels like a school bully straight out of a Disney channel movie. 

My dad at the other side is too obsessed with me becoming a true man, so he took most of my childhood away preparing me to become a adult... Im now less than 2 weeks away from becoming 18, but I don't feel like I was allowed to be a child.

I was diagnosed with Asperger and ADHD when I was around 3 or 5. My mom hid this information from me and never went forward with proper medication. She had lots of arguments with my school's principal who wanted to get me into medication because I was struggling a lot, my mom refused and then proceed to tell how evil my principal was cauz she wanted to give me some scary pills. Of course me being 8 just believed what she said. Just now I realize my principal was trying to help.

Im turning 18 soon, I am scared of the idea of getting medication. I guess all of those ideas my mom implanted in my head are still there. I will go see a doctor as soon as I can after I turn 18.

Thing have gotten pretty bad since around 5 - 6 years ago. My grandpa died, and I kinda entered this state of grief I feel Im still stuck on. And just this year lost my great grandpa and one of my grandma's sisters. One died of old age, the other of cancer, few weeks apart. I feel I could have spent more time with all 3 of them, but now they are gone. 

I get little moments of happiness here and there, but they quickly fade away, and Im just left wanting more.

Around people Ive forced my self to put up a act. I look happy, genuinely happy, but I don't feel like so, my words and actions reflect how I truly feel. I haven't found a way to change that.


Recently I've began losing my self on videogames to keep me busy. I enjoy flighting games a lot and I also practice martial arts. I recently got into smash and Im very bad but I like to play with my friends whether I win or lose it kinda makes me feel happy to play with them, so I keep asking them 24/7 to play and I think Im starting to anoy them, I don't want that, I just want that warm feeling I get when I play with them.

1,"Putting this into the void.. I need to get some things off my chest.

I dont know what's wrong with me. I'm so fucking tired of being this person. My whole life I've felt off.. I can't remember a time I was really happy, at least for a prolonged period of time. I barely have any memory of my childhood/past. I remember some stories, only ones that I've been told or that I have told to others, but it doesn't feel like I lived them. I feel like I cause all the bad the bad things that happen around me. I don't know how to describe it but it feels like there is something gross and evil in me.. its taking everything from me and everyone around me. And I feel like everyone knows it and hates me for it.

When I was 15 my mom committed suicide. I will never forgive myself for my selfishness when she was sick. I blame myself. She did it while my dad was picking me up and we found her when we got home. I was buying ice cream when she was taking her last breath. The last conversation I had with her was a fight over something stupid of course, me being myself. My mom was amazing and nothing like me, except for the mental illness I guess. She was outgoing and loving and intelligent. I can't help but feel like I made her sick. Its hard for me to remember a lot about her because thinking of it is too painful so I try to avoid it.. its always playing in the back of my mind though.

I've tried... even when I was younger, like 10/11, I tried therapy but it didn't  help. I've been to a lot of therapists off and on since then but nothing has stuck. I started grief counselling this year but there's nothing that can be said that changes the things I'm feeling. I was on SSRIs for 4 years and finally gave up trying with them after being stuck in this cycle for so long. I'm on Wellbutrin now and some of the apathy from SSRIs is gone, but some days I'm too emotional to function. I'm talking hours and hours of sobbing and just overwhelming sadness. I do get out of bed most days now though. Also, it makes me inconsolably horny... I am pathetic!!!!

I'm 20 now. I'm in third year of university, I'm going through the motions but it feels empty. I do things I regret constantly. I have a problem with binge drinking until I black out completely and throw up everywhere. Usually someone else cleans it up because I pass out. I'm so tired of being this burden on everyone around me. Theres some sick part of me that loves feeling like this.. I put myself in bad situations that I know I'll regret, like having sex with a stranger that I'm not even attracted to. But something inside is telling me that this is what I deserve, and I believe it. I dont deserve to be happy. The problem is that I want to take care of others so badly and be needed by someone, but it feels like its always the other way around. I am grateful for the amazing people in my life who take care of me and put up with it but I feel like telling them to stop, since nothing they do will ever change who I am and they're wasting their energy. 

I think I'm losing it. I've been questioning my thoughts and memories and I don't trust myself or my brain anymore. I sleep excessively but feel like I'm never fully awake, just being dragged through life semi-consciously. I lose track of thoughts and words, I can't focus on anything, my mind wanders into nothingness all the time. 

Is it ever going to change? I've been waiting my whole life for something to shift, or magically click and everything makes sense and I can stop feeling like this but I'm losing hope.
