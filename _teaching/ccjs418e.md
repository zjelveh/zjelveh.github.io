You may be familiar with headlines like X or Y. They present the awesome power of machine learning. 
What do these models do ?

But what about 

Usefulness vs accuracy

but what if tht algorithm is built on data people believe to be bised

Prediction, or what 

travel time prediction

This course is an introduction to the use of prediction in decision-making in the criminal justice system.

The main example we will use is the decision by a judge whether to detain or release a defendant prior to their trial. Pretrial detention is

### What is a prediction?
In part 1 of the course, we will discuss what it means to make a prediction from data. To do that, we will go over the basics of probability theory (laws of probability, difference between joint/marginal/conditional probabilities, Bayes theorem). At the end of this section, you will learn that when we are talking about generating a prediction like the one made by a judge, we are talking about estimating a conditional probability.

### Generating conditional probabilities
In part 2 of the course, we will cover a sequence of machine learning models that generate predictions (i.e. estimate conditional probabilities): Naive Bayes, Linear/Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. We will also introduce the concept of probabilistic calibration --- 
We will cover how each subsequent algorithm in the sequence improves upon a shortcoming of the algorithm that came before it. For example, the first algorithm we cover, Naive Bayes...

### Bias in, bias out?
The data that is used to build risk assessment algorithms has been generated by past human decisions. For example, let's say that a data scientist is building an algorithm that uses information about defendants' prior arrests to predict their likelihood of being re-arrested in the future. 

How does an arrest show up in the data that the data scientist is using? A police officer chose to make the arrest
How does the officer find out about crime? The officer observes it themselves or it was reported (e.g. via a 911 call)

This example illustrates that administrative data is not an error-free reflection, it is instead a reflection. 

This has two important implications for knowing whether algorithms are actually useful
1) Bias
2) Knowing whether the

In part 3 of the course, we will cover two related topics dealing with the fact that the data we work with is often a function of past human decisions:
- The first is the critical concern that algorithms that use 
- 

### Hands on practice with Python/Jupyter notebooks
We will ground the concepts we cover during lectures through problems sets, quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. In particular, we will spend a significant amount of time working with with Python.
