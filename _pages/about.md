I am an Assistant Professor at the [iSchool](https://ischool.umd.edu/) as well as the [Criminology and Criminal Justice](https://ccjs.umd.edu/) department at the University of Maryland. I'm currently working in the three following areas:

 - Developing and evaluating prediction models in the domains of domestic violence, gun violence, and behavioral health.
 - Developing record linkage methods tailored for administrative data   
 - Studying the science production function, specifically the incentives that generate specification search (a.k.a. p-hacking) and the effectiveness of approaches for curtailing it. 

I was previously a Research Director at the New York City office of [Crime Lab](https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/labs/crime-new-york), a University of Chicago research institute that partners with civic and community leaders in Chicago, New York City, and New Jersey to design, test, and scale promising programs and policies to reduce crime and violence. I finished my Ph.D. in Computer Science at New York Universityâ€™s Tandon School of Engineering in January 2017.
