# CCJS 418E: Coding for Criminology (Fall 2025)
**Location + Time:** [SQH 1117 0207](https://25live.collegenet.com/pro/umd#!/home/location/2377/details), Tuesday (Online) / Thursdays (SQH) 3.30 to 4.45 p.m. 

## Course Description
This course introduces criminology students to data analysis using Python programming and artificial intelligence tools. Criminal justice increasingly relies on data for major decisions—from setting bail to deploying patrols. This course teaches you to analyze that data using modern tools while understanding what's happening behind the scenes.

We begin with computational thinking, which is essentially a structured way to approach complex problems. You'll learn to break big questions into smaller pieces and identify patterns in data. These mental tools matter whether you're investigating crime trends or evaluating whether a new policy actually works. They're useful on their own but become essential once we start programming.

The course then introduces Python, which has become the go-to programming language for data analysis. You'll learn the fundamentals through real examples from criminal justice. Instead of printing "Hello World," you'll be calculating crime rates. Instead of abstract math problems, you'll analyze actual arrest data.

Most of our time will focus on pandas, Python's main tool for working with data. This is where things get interesting. You'll investigate questions that matter in criminology: Why do certain neighborhoods see more repeat offenses? How do arrest patterns change over time? What happens to recidivism rates after policy changes? You'll learn to clean messy data, run basic statistics, and create visualizations that actually tell a story.

We embrace AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude from day one because they're becoming standard in programming work. These tools excel at both writing and explaining code, and they can accelerate your learning significantly. However, using these tools without understanding what they produce is like using Google Translate without knowing if the translation makes sense. The assessments in this class ensure you develop real understanding alongside AI assistance.

You'll complete three problem sets throughout the semester plus a final project and presentation. You're encouraged to use AI tools to help complete these assignments. However, grading happens through one-on-one code reviews where you'll walk me through your solution and explain what your code does. During these 10-minute conversations, you should be prepared to answer questions about how your code works, what would happen if we changed certain parts, and what your results mean in the context of criminology. These aren't intimidating exams—they're collaborative discussions focused on making sure you understand the tools you're using.

By the end of the course, you'll be able to work with criminal justice data, run meaningful analyses, and create useful visualizations. Most importantly, you'll understand what your code is doing and be able to adapt it when your research questions change.


## Course Objectives
After completing this course, students will be able to:
1. Apply computational thinking principles to break down complex criminological problems into manageable steps

## Assessment
<details>
<summary class="section-heading">Problem Sets (60% total - 20% each)</summary>
You will complete three problem sets throughout the semester that build on each other:
<ul>
    <li><strong>Problem Set 1 (9/28)</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>Problem Set 2 (10/19)</strong> </li>
    <li><strong>Problem Set 3 (11/23)</strong> </li>
</ul>
<strong>How Problem Sets Work:</strong>
<ul>
<li>You submit working code on the Sunday that it is due (use any resources, including AI tools)</li>
<li>The next Tuesday, you'll have a 10 to 15 minute code review session with me during class</li>
<li>During the review, you'll walk me through your code and answer questions about:
  <ul>
    <li>What specific lines of code do</li>
    <li>What would happen if we changed certain parts</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Grading is based primarily on your explanation and understanding during the review, less on whether the code works</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details>
<summary class="section-heading">Project Proposal (10%)</summary>
Due November 2nd, you'll submit a 2-3 page proposal that demonstrates computational thinking. Details on the proposal to come. 
<!-- The proposal should include:
<ul>
<li><strong>Main Question & Decomposition:</strong><br>
Start with your big question, then break it into 3-4 smaller, answerable sub-questions. For example, "What factors influence recidivism?" becomes:
  <ul>
    <li>How does recidivism vary by age group?</li>
    <li>Is there a relationship between offense type and reoffending?</li>
    <li>Do certain neighborhoods have higher recidivism rates?</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Data & Abstraction:</strong><br>
Describe your dataset and explicitly identify. In the recidivism example, they coud be: 
  <ul>
    <li>Which variables you'll focus on (and why they matter)</li>
    <li>Which variables you'll ignore (and why they're not relevant)</li>
    <li>What unit of analysis you'll use (person, incident, neighborhood, etc.)</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Analysis Plan - Step by Step:</strong><br>
Provide a numbered, sequential plan showing exactly how you'll answer your questions:
  <ol>
    <li>Load data and check for missing values</li>
    <li>Create new variables (e.g., age groups from birth dates)</li>
    <li>Calculate summary statistics for each sub-question</li>
    <li>Create specific visualizations (name the plot type and variables)</li>
    <li>Compare patterns across groups</li>
  </ol>
  Be specific—don't just say "analyze the data," explain the actual steps.</li>
<li><strong>Pattern Expectations (0.5 page):</strong><br>
What patterns do you expect to find? What would surprise you? How will you know if your analysis is working correctly?</li>
</ul>
<strong>Requirements:</strong>
<ul>
